    "abstract": "Although Western diet and dysbiosis are the most prominent environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the corresponding host factors and cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we report that the TSC1/mTOR pathway in the gut epithelium represents a metabolic and innate immune checkpoint for intestinal dysfunction and inflammation. mTOR hyperactivation triggered by Western diet or Tsc1 ablation led to epithelium necroptosis, barrier disruption, and predisposition to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and inflammation-associated colon cancer. Mechanistically, our results uncovered a critical role for TSC1/mTOR in restraining the expression and activation of RIPK3 in the gut epithelium through TRIM11-mediated ubiquitination and autophagy-dependent degradation. Notably, microbiota depletion by antibiotics or gnotobiotics attenuated RIPK3 expression and activation, thereby alleviating epithelial necroptosis and colitis driven by mTOR hyperactivation. mTOR primarily impinged on RIPK3 to potentiate necroptosis induced by TNF and by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and hyperactive mTOR and aberrant necroptosis were intertwined in human IBDs. Together, our data reveal a previously unsuspected link between the Western diet, microbiota, and necroptosis and identify the mTOR/RIPK3/necroptosis axis as a driving force for intestinal inflammation and cancer.",

    "title": "GSK3 and its interactions with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling network.",
    "issue": "65()",
    "pages": "5-15",
    "abstract": "Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3 or GSK-3) is a promiscuous protein kinase and its phosphorylation of its diverse substrates has major influences on many areas of physiology and pathology, including cellular metabolism, lineage commitment and neuroscience. GSK3 was one of the first identified substrates of the heavily studied oncogenic kinase AKT, phosphorylation by which inhibits GSK3 activity via the formation of an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence. This has led to investigation of the role of GSK3 inhibition as a key component of the cellular responses to growth factors and insulin, which stimulate the class I PI 3-Kinases and in turn AKT activity and GSK3 phosphorylation. GSK3 has been shown to phosphorylate several upstream and downstream components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling network, including AKT itself, RICTOR, TSC1 and 2, PTEN and IRS1 and 2, with the potential to apply feedback control within the network. However, it has been clear for some time that functionally distinct, insulated pools of GSK3 exist which are regulated independently, so that for some GSK3 substrates such as β-catenin, phosphorylation by GSK3 is not controlled by input from PI3K and AKT. Instead, as almost all GSK3 substrates require a priming phosphorylated residue to be 4 amino acids C-terminal to the Ser/Thr phosphorylated by GSK3, the predominant form of regulation of the activity of GSK3 often appears to be through control over these priming events, specific to individual substrates. Therefore, a major role of GSK3 can be viewed as an amplifier of the electrostatic effects on protein function which are caused by these priming phosphorylation events. Here we discuss these different aspects to GSK3 regulation and function, and the functions of GSK3 as it integrates with signalling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling axis.",

    "title": "Differentiating the mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex.",
    "issue": "17(12)",
    "pages": "1550-9",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign tumor-like lesions, called hamartomas, in multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, heart, kidneys, and lung. These hamartomas cause a diverse set of clinical problems based on their location and often result in epilepsy, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. TSC is caused by mutations within the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that inactivate the genes' tumor-suppressive function and drive hamartomatous cell growth. In normal cells, TSC1 and TSC2 integrate growth signals and nutrient inputs to downregulate signaling to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase that controls cell growth and cell survival. The molecular connection between TSC and mTOR led to the clinical use of allosteric mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) for the treatment of TSC. Everolimus is approved for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas in patients with TSC. Sirolimus, though not approved for TSC, has undergone considerable investigation to treat various aspects of the disease. Everolimus and sirolimus selectively inhibit mTOR signaling with similar molecular mechanisms, but with distinct clinical profiles. This review differentiates mTOR inhibitors in TSC while describing the molecular mechanisms, pathogenic mutations, and clinical trial outcomes for managing TSC.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in various human cancers and has been considered a promising therapeutic target. Many of the positive regulators of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, including the catalytic (p110α) and regulatory (p85α), of class IA PI3K, AKT, RHEB, mTOR, and eIF4E, possess oncogenic potentials, as demonstrated by transformation assays in vitro and by genetically engineered mouse models in vivo. Genetic evidences also indicate their roles in malignancies induced by activation of the upstream oncoproteins including receptor tyrosine kinases and RAS and those induced by the loss of the negative regulators of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway such as PTEN, TSC1/2, LKB1, and PIPP. Possible mechanisms by which the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis contributes to oncogenic transformation include stimulation of proliferation, survival, metabolic reprogramming, and invasion/metastasis, as well as suppression of autophagy and senescence. These phenotypic changes are mediated by eIF4E-induced translation of a subset of mRNAs and by other downstream effectors of mTORC1 including S6K, HIF-1α, PGC-1α, SREBP, and ULK1 complex.",

    "issue": "74(1)",
    "pages": "96-108",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\np53 mutations occur frequently in human HCC. Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is also associated with HCC. However, it is still unknown whether these changes together initiate HCC and can be targeted as a potential therapeutic strategy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe generated mouse models in which mTOR was hyperactivated by loss of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) with or without p53 haplodeficiency. Primary cells were isolated from mouse livers. Oncogenic signalling was assessed in vitro and in vivo, with or without targeted inhibition of a single molecule or multiple molecules. Transcriptional profiling was used to identify biomarkers predictive of HCC. Human HCC materials were used to corroborate the findings from mouse models.\n\n\nRESULTS\np53 haploinsufficiency facilitates mTOR signalling via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt axis, promoting HCC tumorigenesis and lung metastasis. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt reduced mTOR activity, which effectively enhanced the anticancer effort of an mTOR inhibitor. ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (Abcc4) was found to be responsible for p53 haploinsufficiency- and Tsc1 loss-driven HCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, in clinical HCC samples, Abcc4 was specifically identified an aggressive subtype. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin significantly reduced hepatocarcinogenesis triggered by Tsc1 loss and p53 haploinsufficiency in vivo, as well as the biomarker Abcc4.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data advance the current understanding of the activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and its downstream target Abcc4 in hepatocarcinogenesis driven by p53 reduction and Tsc1 loss. Targeting mTOR, an unexpected vulnerability in p53 (haplo)deficiency HCC, can be exploited therapeutically to treat Abcc4-positive patients with HCC.\n\n\nLAY SUMMARY\nTsc1 loss facilitates the p53 (haplo)insufficiency-mediated activation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis, leading to the elevated expression of Abcc4 to drive HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis in mice. Inhibition of mTOR protects against p53 haploinsufficiency and Tsc1 loss-triggered tumour-promoting activity, providing a new approach for treating an aggressive subtype of HCC exhibiting high Abcc4 expression.",

    "abstract": "Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (SKS) OMIM #616638, also known as MINDS syndrome (ORPHA 457485), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder reported so far in 23 patients. SKS is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly/hemi/megalencephaly, and seizures. It is also associated with a pattern of facial dysmorphology and other non-neurological features. Germline or mosaic mutations of the mTOR gene have been detected in all patients. The mTOR gene is a key regulator of cell growth, cell proliferation, protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, and the mTOR pathway (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) is highly regulated and critical for cell survival and apoptosis. Mutations in different genes in this pathway result in known rare diseases implicated in hemi/megalencephaly with epilepsy, as the tuberous sclerosis complex caused by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, or the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). We here present 4 new cases of SKS, review all clinical and molecular aspects of this disorder, as well as some characteristics of the patients with only brain mTOR somatic mutations.",

    "abstract": "The Tsc1-mTOR signaling pathway is often related to obesity, and epigenetic modification may lead to expression changes of obesity-related gene. Therefore, we aim to investigate the methylation of the Tsc1-mTOR signaling pathway in regulation of obesity susceptibility. Wistar rats were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet to develop animal models. Protein and mRNA expression levels of Tsc1-mTOR signaling in the hypothalamus were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Methylation of Tsc1 gene promoter was detected by bisulfite genomic sequence. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of Tsc1 in DIO group hypothalamus were lower; mTOR and its downstream targets S6K1, 4EBP1, and S6 protein expression levels were higher than those of the DIO-R group and the chow group. The Tsc1 gene promoter methylation rate in the hypothalamus was 92.05 ± 3.07% in the DIO group, 87.27 ± 1.91% in the DIO-R group, and 88.18% ± 3.20% in the chow group, respectively, with significantly higher levels in the DIO group. Both the expression levels of Tsc1 gene promoter methylation and Tsc1-mTOR signaling pathway in the hypothalamus of DIO rats and DIO-R rats are different. These findings may shed light on the potential mechanism for the differentiation of obesity susceptibility.",

    "issue": "14(3)",
    "pages": "299-304",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe mammalian circadian clock and its associated clock genes are increasingly been recognized as critical components for a number of physiological and disease processes that extend beyond hormone release, thermal regulation, and sleep-wake cycles. New evidence suggests that clinical behavior disruptions that involve prolonged shift work and even space travel may negatively impact circadian rhythm and lead to multi-system disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn light of the significant role circadian rhythm can hold over the body's normal physiology as well as disease processes, we examined and discussed the impact circadian rhythm and clock genes hold over lifespan, neurodegenerative disorders, and tumorigenesis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn experimental models, lifespan is significantly reduced with the introduction of arrhythmic mutants and leads to an increase in oxidative stress exposure. Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the circadian clock system relies upon the regulation of the critical pathways of autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) as well as proliferative mechanisms that involve the wingless pathway of Wnt/β-catenin pathway to foster cell survival during injury and block tumor cell growth.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFuture targeting of the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm may hold the key for the development of novel and effective therapies against aging- related disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of hamartomas in a wide range of human tissues. Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene is responsible for both the familial and sporadic forms of this disease. TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a physical and functional complex in vivo. Here, we show that TSC1-TSC2 inhibits the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (an activator of translation) and activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, an inhibitor of translational initiation). These functions of TSC1-TSC2 are mediated by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, TSC2 is directly phosphorylated by Akt, which is involved in stimulating cell growth and is activated by growth stimulating signals, such as insulin. TSC2 is inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, which destabilizes TSC2 and disrupts its interaction with TSC1. Our data indicate a molecular mechanism for TSC2 in insulin signalling, tumour suppressor functions and in the inhibition of cell growth.",

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by multi-system tumor and hamartoma development. Mutation and loss of function of TSC1 and/or TSC2 also occur in a variety of sporadic cancers, and rapamycin and related drugs show highly variable treatment benefit in patients with such cancers. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins function in a complex that inhibits mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth, which acts to enhance anabolic biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we identified and validated five cancer cell lines with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations and performed a kinase inhibitor drug screen with 197 compounds. The five cell lines were sensitive to several mTOR inhibitors, and cell cycle kinase and HSP90 kinase inhibitors. The IC50 for Torin1 and INK128, both mTOR kinase inhibitors, was significantly increased in three TSC2 null cell lines in which TSC2 expression was restored. Rapamycin was significantly more effective than either INK128 or ganetespib (an HSP90 inhibitor) in reducing the growth of TSC2 null SNU-398 cells in a xenograft model. Combination ganetespib-rapamycin showed no significant enhancement of growth suppression over rapamycin. Hence, although HSP90 inhibitors show strong inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 null cell line growth in vitro, ganetespib showed little benefit at standard dosage in vivo. In contrast, rapamycin which showed very modest growth inhibition in vitro was the best agent for in vivo treatment, but did not cause tumor regression, only growth delay.",

    "issue": "488(7413)",
    "pages": "647-51",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs. However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology. Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits. These findings demonstrate new roles for Tsc1 in PC function and define a molecular basis for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive disorders such as autism.",

    "pages": "1435-1444",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors are key drugs for the treatment of many tumor types, however, there are no predictive biomarkers in clinical use. Here, we performed a molecular and immunohistochemical characterization of key mTOR pathway components in a series of 105 renal cell carcinoma patients treated with rapalogs, aimed at identifying markers of treatment response. Mutational analysis in MTOR, TSC1 and TSC2 was performed through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for PTEN, pAKT, pS6K1, pS6 and p21. Among patients with NGS data, 11 of 87 (13%) had mTOR pathway mutations (8 in MTOR, 1 in TSC1 and 2 in TSC2). When comparing the molecular data to the response of the patients, we found that partial response was more frequent in cases with mTOR pathway mutations than in those without mutations (odds ratio [OR] = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.008-0.79, p = 0.030 univariate; p = 0.038 multivariable). Regarding IHC, negative PTEN staining was detected in 58% of the tumors, and it was more frequent in rapalog responder patients (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.065-0.86, p = 0.029 univariate; p = 0.029 multivariable). Mutations and PTEN IHC were not mutually exclusive events and its combination improved response prediction (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04-0.62, p = 0.008 univariate; p = 0.013 multivariable). The staining of other proteins did not show and association with response and no association with PFS was observed in unselected patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mTOR pathway mutations, negative PTEN IHC and their combination are potential markers of rapalog response.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects multiple organ systems and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of two genes: TSC1 or TSC2. The disorder can affect both adults and children. First described in depth by Bourneville in 1880, it is now estimated that nearly 2 million people are affected by the disease worldwide. The clinical features of TSC are distinctive and can vary widely between individuals, even within one family. Major features of the disease include tumours of the brain, skin, heart, lungs and kidneys, seizures and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, which can include autism spectrum disorder and cognitive disability. TSC1 (also known as hamartin) and TSC2 (also known as tuberin) form the TSC protein complex that acts as an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, which in turn plays a pivotal part in regulating cell growth, proliferation, autophagy and protein and lipid synthesis. Remarkable progress in basic and translational research, in addition to several randomized controlled trials worldwide, has led to regulatory approval of the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas, brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, but further research is needed to establish full indications of therapeutic treatment. In this Primer, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in the TSC field, including the molecular and cellular basis of the disease, medical management, major knowledge gaps and ongoing research towards a cure.",

    "abstract": "Since its initial discovery as the gene altered in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder, the interest in TSC1 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1) has steadily risen. TSC1, an essential component of the pro-survival PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway, plays an important role in processes like development, cell growth and proliferation, survival, autophagy and cilia development by co-operating with a variety of regulatory molecules. Recent studies have emphasized the tumor suppressive role of TSC1 in several human cancers including liver, lung, bladder, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. TSC1 perceives inputs from various signaling pathways, including TNF-α/IKK-β, TGF-β-Smad2/3, AKT/Foxo/Bim, Wnt/β-catenin/Notch, and MTOR/Mdm2/p53 axis, thereby regulating cancer cell proliferation, metabolism, migration, invasion, and immune regulation. This review provides a first comprehensive evaluation of TSC1 and illuminates its diverse functions apart from its involvement in TSC genetic disorder. Further, we have summarized the physiological functions of TSC1 in various cellular events and conditions whose dysregulation may lead to several pathological manifestations including cancer.",

    "pages": "471-6",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant human genetic disorder in which distinctive tumors called hamartomas develop. Germline mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause this syndrome, and hamartomas typically display second hit events with loss of the remaining normal allele. Studies initiated in Drosophila have identified a role for the Tsc1 and Tsc2 genes in the regulation of cell and organ size, and genetic interaction studies have placed them in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway. Biochemical studies have shown that activated Akt phosphorylates TSC2 in the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, inactivating it; while TSC1/TSC2 has GAP activity for the Rheb GTPase (a member of the ras family), and activated Rheb-GTP activates mTOR. Thus, in cells lacking TSC1 or TSC2 there are increased levels of Rheb-GTP which leads to activation of mTOR, leading to cell size increase and growth. These developments provide enhanced understanding of this signaling pathway and fundamental insights into the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis, and open the possibility of treatment for hamartomas by several pharmacologic approaches.",

    "issue": "203()",
    "pages": "108399",
    "abstract": "Alkali burn to the cornea is one of the most intractable injuries to the eye due to the opacity resulting from neovascularization (NV) and fibrosis. Numerous studies have focused on studying the effect of drugs on alkali-induced corneal injury in mouse, but fewer on the involvement of alkali-induced DNA methylation and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the mechanism of alkali-induced corneal injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the involvement of DNA methyltransferase 3 B-madiated DNA methylation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling modulation in the mechanism of alkali-induced corneal injury in a mouse model. To this end, we used bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, to study the effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, which inhibit methyltransferase and PI3K respectively, on DNA methylation and expression of downstream effectors of PI3K related to corneal NV, including TSC1 and mTOR genes. The results showed that, after an intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (2 mg/kg/day) for seven days, the alkali-induced opacity and NV were remarkably decreased mainly by suppressing the infiltration of immune cells into injured corneas, angiogenesis, VEGF expression and myofibroblasts differentiation; as well as by promoting corneal cell proliferation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. More significantly, these findings showed that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by DNA methylation played a key role in corneal NV, including in corneal alkali burn-induced methylation modification and rapamycin-induced DNA demethylation which involved the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway at the protein level. The precise findings of morphological improvement and regulatory mechanisms are helpful to guide the use of rapamycin in the treatment of corneal angiogenesis induced by alkaline-burn.",

    "title": "TSC1 controls macrophage polarization to prevent inflammatory disease.",
    "issue": "5()",
    "pages": "4696",
    "abstract": "Macrophages acquire distinct phenotypes during tissue stress and inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms that regulate the macrophage polarization are poorly defined. Here we show that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a critical regulator of M1 and M2 phenotypes of macrophages. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of TSC1 exhibit enhanced M1 response and spontaneously develop M1-related inflammatory disorders. However, TSC1-deficient mice are highly resistant to M2-polarized allergic asthma. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) fails to reverse the hypersensitive M1 response of TSC1-deficient macrophages, but efficiently rescues the defective M2 polarization. Deletion of mTOR also fails to reverse the enhanced inflammatory response of TSC1-deficient macrophages. Molecular studies indicate that TSC1 inhibits M1 polarization by suppressing the Ras GTPase-Raf1-MEK-ERK pathway in mTOR-independent manner, whereas TSC1 promotes M2 properties by mTOR-dependent CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β pathways. Overall, these findings define a key role for TSC1 in orchestrating macrophage polarization via mTOR-dependent and independent pathways.",

    "abstract": "Gene deletion studies in mice and in Drosophila have shown that the 40S ribosomal protein S6 Kinases, dS6K in Drosophila and S6K1 and S6K2 in mice are important regulators of cell growth in response to insulin stimulation and nutrition availability. Here we chiefly focus on dS6k and S6K1, whose activities are regulated by an upstream kinase termed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, or dTOR in Drosophila). Our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the mTOR/S6K1-signalling pathway will be fundamental in determining the mechanisms which control cell growth in response to insulin signalling. Recent findings from this laboratory and others suggests that the tumour suppressor complex made of two proteins TSC1/hamartin and TSC2/tuberin, acts as a negative regulator of mTOR/S6K1 signalling. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are genetically linked to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, which can lead to severe pathological consequences, including mental retardation, epilepsy and autism, as well as cardiac, pulmonary and renal failure. Despite a large number of initial reports on the TSC1/TSC2 complex, and the finding that its activity is regulated by protein kinase B (PKB), the direct target of the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex was unknown until recently. Since TSC2 has a GTPase-activating domain, or GAP-like sequence, others and we searched for a small GTP binding protein, which may serve as the target of TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex. In our case we took advantage of a genome wide screen in Drosophila for effectors of cell growth and in parallel searched for a small GTPase whose activity is up-regulated in TSC2-deficient cells. The identified gene was a member of the Ras family of GTPases termed Ras homologue enriched in brain or Rheb. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex normally acts on Rheb to mediate mTOR/S6K1-signalling.",

    "title": "\"Renal Cell Carcinoma With Leiomyomatous Stroma\" Harbor Somatic Mutations of TSC1, TSC2, MTOR, and/or ELOC (TCEB1): Clinicopathologic and Molecular Characterization of 18 Sporadic Tumors Supports a Distinct Entity.",
    "issue": "44(5)",
    "pages": "571-581",
    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma with (angio) leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLMS) is included as a provisional entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of renal epithelial neoplasia; however, debate remains whether it represents a distinct entity or a heterogenous group of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with overlapping morphology. Also, its relationship to similar tumors occurring in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is not fully addressed. We analyzed the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics of 23 sporadic RCCs associated with smooth muscle stroma and classified them into 2 groups, independent of molecular results: (1) RCCLMS (n=18) and (2) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) (n=5). The classification of a case as \"RCCLMS\" was based on morphologic comparison with 5 \"index\" RCCs from 3 patients with TSC showing similar features and the presence of diffuse CK7 expression. To investigate mutational and copy number alterations, a 170-gene solid tumor panel was utilized to sequence 14 RCCLMSs and control of 5 CCRCCs. Also, 4 RCCLMSs, suspicious for chromosome 8 monosomy, were further evaluated by a broader 479 gene sequencing panel that included ELOC (also referred to as TCEB1). Clinical information and follow-up data were obtained from electronic medical records. The mean age of patients with RCCLMS was 52 years (range, 33 to 69) with male:female ratio of 1:2. Macroscopically, all tumors were solitary and predominantly (82%) tan/red, circumscribed, and solid. The average tumor size was 2.3 cm (range, 1.1 to 4.5). Microscopically, the distinctive feature included tumor nodules of elongated and frequently branching tubules lined by cells with voluminous clear to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm (100%), separated by focal to prominent smooth muscle stroma. Additional frequently identified features included: biphasic pattern of collapsed acini surrounding tubules with voluminous cytoplasm (50%), focal papillary architecture (39%), peritumoral lymphoid aggregates (39%), and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (33%). All 11 (100%) RCCLMSs with available staging information were pT1; 78% were WHO/International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 and 22% grade 3. Immunophenotypically, RCCLMSs were characterized by diffuse CK7, CAM5.2 and CD10 reactivity (100%). All patients with available follow-up (n=10) were alive and without disease progression after a mean and median follow-up of 25.2 (range: 1 to 58) and 25 months, respectively. The molecular results showed recurrent mutations in all RCCLMS: TSC1 (4), TSC2 (4), MTOR (6), and/or ELOC (2). Five control CCRCCs demonstrated primary alterations in VHL gene, while all 14 RCCLMS cases tested had intact VHL gene. Of 2 RCCLMSs with confirmed monosomy 8, 1 showed a hotspot ELOC mutation without TSC/MTOR mutations, and 1 showed a previously undescribed 3-bp in-frame ELOC deletion, along with a truncating TSC1 mutation. In conclusion, RCCLMS, as defined herein, harbors recurrent mutations of TSC1/TSC2, MTOR, and/or ELOC, consistent with hyperactive MTOR complex. Our findings argue that these tumors represent the sporadic counterpart to morphologically identical tumors occurring in TSC patients. Finally, the data support that RCCLMS is a novel subtype of RCC with unique morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics that is distinct from CCRCC and clear cell-papillary RCC.",

    "pages": "e48791",
    "abstract": "PI3K-Akt-FoxO-mTOR signaling is the central pathway controlling growth and metabolism in all cells. Ubiquitination of the protein kinase Akt prior to its phosphorylation is required for PI3K-Akt activity. Here, we found that the deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme USP1 removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on Akt to restrict PI3K-Akt-FoxO signaling in mouse muscle during prolonged starvation. DUB screening platform identified USP1 as a direct DUB for Akt, and USP1 depletion in mouse muscle increased Akt ubiquitination, PI3K-Akt-FoxO signaling, and glucose uptake during fasting. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified disabled homolog-2 (Dab2), the tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1/TSC2, and PHLPP1 as USP1 bound proteins. During starvation, Dab2 is essential for Akt recruitment to USP1-TSC1-PHLPP1 complex, and for PI3K-Akt-FoxO inhibition. Surprisingly, USP1 limits TSC1 levels to sustain mTOR-mediated basal protein synthesis rates and maintain its own protein levels. We propose that Dab2 recruits Akt to USP1-TSC1-PHLPP1 complex to efficiently terminate the transmission of growth signals when cellular energy level is low.",

    "title": "The TSC-mTOR pathway regulates macrophage polarization.",
    "issue": "4()",
    "pages": "2834",
    "abstract": "Macrophages are able to polarize to proinflammatory M1 or alternative M2 states with distinct phenotypes and physiological functions. How metabolic status regulates macrophage polarization remains not well understood, and here we examine the role of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), a central metabolic pathway that couples nutrient sensing to regulation of metabolic processes. Using a mouse model in which myeloid lineage-specific deletion of Tsc1 (Tsc1(Δ/Δ)) leads to constitutive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, we find that Tsc1(Δ/Δ) macrophages are refractory to IL-4-induced M2 polarization, but produce increased inflammatory responses to proinflammatory stimuli. Moreover, mTORC1-mediated downregulation of Akt signalling critically contributes to defective polarization. These findings highlight a key role for the mTOR pathway in regulating macrophage polarization, and suggest how nutrient sensing and metabolic status could be 'hard-wired' to control of macrophage function, with broad implications for regulation of type 2 immunity, inflammation and allergy.",

    "title": "mTOR Activation Initiates Renal Cell Carcinoma Development by Coordinating ERK and p38MAPK.",
    "issue": "81(12)",
    "pages": "3174-3186",
    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) mainly originates from renal proximal tubules. Intriguingly, disruption of genes frequently mutated in human RCC samples thus far has only generated RCC originated from other renal tubule parts in mouse models. This hampers our understanding of the pathogenesis of RCC. Here we show that mTOR signaling, often activated in RCC samples, initiates RCC development from renal proximal tubules. Ablation of Tsc1, encoding an mTOR suppressor, in proximal tubule cells led to multiple precancerous renal cysts. mTOR activation increased MEK1 expression and ERK activation, and Mek1 ablation or inhibition diminished cyst formation in Tsc1-deficient mice. mTOR activation also increased MKK6 expression and p38MAPK activation, and ablation of the p38α-encoding gene further enhanced cyst formation and led to RCC with clear cell RCC features. Mechanistically, Tsc1 deletion induced p53 and p16 expression in a p38MAPK-dependent manner, and deleting Tsc1 and Trp53 or Cdkn2a (encoding p16) enhanced renal cell carcinogenesis. Thus, mTOR activation in combination with inactivation of the p38MAPK-p53/p16 pathway drives RCC development from renal proximal tubules. Moreover, this study uncovers previously unidentified mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation and suggests the MEK-ERK axis to be a potential target for treatment of RCC. SIGNIFICANCE: Mouse modeling studies show that mTOR activation in combination with inactivation of the p38MAPK-p53/p16 axis initiates renal cell carcinoma that mimics human disease, identifying potential therapeutic targets for RCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGastric adenocarcinoma is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world. Except for HER2-targeted therapy, targeted agents against specific molecules participating in gastric carcinogenesis, including those in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) pathway have not been proved to be effective. However, some studies have suggested that dysfunction of TSC1 may augment mTOR inhibitor activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied p-mTOR and TSC1 status by immunohistochemical analysis of gastric carcinoma samples using a tissue microarray method and expression values adopted from The Cancer Genome Atlas.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigh p-mTOR and low TSC1 expression status is associated with adverse clinicopathologic parameters. Patients with high p-mTOR levels showed poor survival. Patients with low TSC1 levels showed unfavorable survival status in the overall patients group. The combination of p-mTOR status and TSC1 status provided more strong survival information than using each parameter alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn gastric cancer, high p-mTOR expression level is a statistically significant parameter in multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses (log-rank test). In addition to p-mTOR, TSC1 expression provided additional information to predict survival. We therefore suggest that evaluation of both p-mTOR and TSC1 status may be helpful in clinical trials related to mTOR inhibitors.",

    "pages": "158-171",
    "abstract": "GPNMB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic B) and other TFE3/TFEB transcriptional targets have been proposed as markers for microphthalmia (MiT) translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs). We recently demonstrated that constitutive mTORC1 activation via TSC1/2 loss leads to increased activity of TFE3/TFEB, suggesting that the pathogenesis and molecular markers for tRCCs and TSC1/2-associated tumors may be overlapping. We examined GPNMB expression in human kidney and angiomyolipoma (AML) cell lines with TSC2 and/or TFE3/TFEB loss produced using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing as well as in a mouse model of Tsc2 inactivation-driven renal tumorigenesis. Using an automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for GPNMB, digital image analysis was employed to quantitatively score expression in clear cell RCC (ccRCC, n = 87), papillary RCC (papRCC, n = 53), chromophobe RCC (chRCC, n = 34), oncocytoma (n = 4), TFE3- or TFEB-driven tRCC (n = 56), eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC (ESC, n = 6), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT, n = 4), and low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT, n = 3), as well as AML (n = 29) and perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas, n = 8). In cell lines, GPNMB was upregulated following TSC2 loss in a MiT/TFE- and mTORC1-dependent fashion. Renal tumors in Tsc2+/- A/J mice showed upregulation of GPNMB compared with normal kidney. Mean GPNMB expression was significantly higher in tRCC than in ccRCC (p < 0.0001), papRCC (p < 0.0001), and chRCC (p < 0.0001). GPNMB expression in TSC1/2/MTOR alteration-associated renal tumors (including ESC, LOT, AML, and PEComa) was comparable to that in tRCC. The immunophenotype of tRCC and TSC1/2/MTOR alteration-associated renal tumors is highly overlapping, likely due to the increased activity of TFE3/TFEB in both, revealing an important caveat regarding the use of TFE3/TFEB-transcriptional targets as diagnostic markers. © 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "mTOR, the sensor of nutrients and growth factors, has important roles in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. However, how mTOR controls gastric epithelial cell turnover and gastric cancer development, a leading malignancy, remains poorly understood. Here, we provide genetic evidence that mTOR activation promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation of Lgr5+ gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs) in gastric homeostasis and tumorigenesis. mTOR signaling increases MEK1 and Smad1 expression and enhances activation of MEK1-ERKs and BMP-Smad1 pathways, respectively, in GEPs and gastric tumors. Mek1 deletion or inhibition rescues hyperproliferation, whereas Bmpr1a ablation or inhibition rescues differentiation defects of Tsc1-/- GEPs. Tsc1 deficiency in Lgr5+ GEPs accelerates gastric tumor initiation and development, which require MEK1-ERKs for hyperplasia and BMP-Smad1 for differentiation suppression. These findings reveal how mTOR signaling controls Lgr5+ GEP homeostasis and cancerization and suggest that ERKs and Smad1 signaling can be safely targeted to substitute mTOR inhibitors in gastric cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOur study aimed to explore the effects of PPIs on reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy in gastric cancer by inhibiting the expression of V-ATPases and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α signal pathway.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901 and the multidrug resistance cell lines SGC7901/MDR were pretreated by the pantoprazole or the esomeprazole, respectively. Real-time PCR was used to determine mRNA levels, and western blotting and immunofluorescent staining analyses were employed to determine the protein expressions and intracellular distributions of the V-ATPases, PI3K, Akt, mTOR, HIF-1α, P-gp and MRP1 before and after PPIs pretreatment. SGC7901/MDR cells were planted on the athymic nude mice. Then the effects of PPZ pretreatment and/or ADR were compared by determining the tumor size, tumor weight and nude mice weight.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPPIs pretreatment could inhibit mRNA levels of V-ATPases, MDR1 and MRP1, PI3K, Akt, mTOR and HIF-1α. PPIs inhibited V-ATPases and down-regulated the expressions of P-gp and MRP1. And further to block the expression of mTOR by Rapamycin could obviously inhibit the expressions of HIF-1α, P-gp and MRP1 in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, PPIs inhibited the expressions of V-ATPases and then reversed MDR of the chemotherapy in gastric cancer by inhibiting P-gp and MRP1, and it could be speculated that the mechanism might be closely related to down-regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway. Meanwhile, PPIs also could inhibit the expressions of TSC1/TSC2 complex and Rheb which might be involved into regulating the signaling pathway intermediately. The weight growth rate of the mice bearing tumor in the treatment group was lower than that of the nude mice in the normal group, while the weight growth rate of the mice in control group was significantly lower than that of the normal group and the treatment group, presenting a downward trend.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTherefore, PPIs inhibited the expressions of V-ATPases and then reversed MDR of the chemotherapy in gastric cancer by inhibiting P-gp and MRP1, and it could be speculated that the mechanism might be closely related to down-regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway, and also to inhibiting the expressions of TSC1/TSC2 complex and Rheb which might be involved into regulating the signaling pathway intermediately.",

    "issue": "17(8)",
    "pages": "e3000420",
    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play pivotal roles in T-cell homeostasis and activation, and metabolic programing has been recently linked to DC development and function. However, the metabolic underpinnings corresponding to distinct DC functions remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate a special metabolic-epigenetic coupling mechanism orchestrated by tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1 (TSC1)-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) for homeostatic DC function. Specific ablation of Tsc1 in the DC compartment (Tsc1DC-KO) largely preserved DC development but led to pronounced reduction in naïve and memory-phenotype cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells, a defect fully rescued by concomitant ablation of mTor or regulatory associated protein of MTOR, complex 1 (Rptor) in DCs. Moreover, Tsc1DC-KO mice were unable to launch efficient antigen-specific CD8+ T effector responses required for containing Listeria monocytogenes and B16 melanomas. Mechanistically, our data suggest that the steady-state DCs tend to tune down de novo fatty acid synthesis and divert acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) for histone acetylation, a process critically controlled by TSC1-mTOR. Correspondingly, TSC1 deficiency elevated acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) expression and fatty acid synthesis, leading to impaired epigenetic imprinting on selective genes such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and interleukin (IL)-7. Remarkably, tempering ACC1 activity was able to divert cytosolic acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation and restore the gene expression program compromised by TSC1 deficiency. Taken together, our results uncover a crucial role for TSC1-mTOR in metabolic programing of the homeostatic DCs for T-cell homeostasis and implicate metabolic-coupled epigenetic imprinting as a paradigm for DC specification.",

    "issue": "22(10)",
    "pages": "2445-2452",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nWe examined the hypothesis that mutations in mTOR pathway genes are associated with response to rapalogs in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWe studied a cohort of mRCC patients who were treated with mTOR inhibitors with distinct clinical outcomes. Tumor DNA from 79 subjects was successfully analyzed for mutations using targeted next-generation sequencing of 560 cancer genes. Responders were defined as those with partial response (PR) by RECIST v1.0 or stable disease with any tumor shrinkage for 6 months or longer. Nonresponders were defined as those with disease progression during the first 3 months of therapy. Fisher exact test assessed the association between mutation status in mTOR pathway genes and treatment response.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMutations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 were more common in responders, 12 (28%) of 43, than nonresponders, 4 (11%) of 36 (P = 0.06). Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 alone were also more common in responders, 9 (21%), than nonresponders, 2(6%), (P = 0.05). Furthermore, 5 (42%) of 12 subjects with PR had mutations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 compared with 4 (11%) of 36 nonresponders (P = 0.03). Eight additional non-mTOR pathway genes were found to be mutated in at least 4 of 79 tumors (5%); none were associated positively with response.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this cohort of mRCC patients, mutations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 were more common in patients who experienced clinical benefit from rapalogs than in those who progressed. However, a substantial fraction of responders (24 of 43, 56%) had no mTOR pathway mutation identified. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2445-52. ©2016 AACRSee related commentary by Voss and Hsieh, p. 2320.",

    "issue": "75(14)",
    "pages": "2663-2680",
    "abstract": "Primary cilia are sensory organelles that coordinate multiple cellular signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (HH), Wingless/Int (WNT) and Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. Similarly, primary cilia have been implicated in regulation of mTOR signaling, in which Tuberous Sclerosis Complex proteins 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) negatively regulate protein synthesis by inactivating the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) at energy limiting states. Here we report that TSC1 and TSC2 regulate Smoothened (SMO)-dependent HH signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Reduced SMO-dependent expression of Gli1 was demonstrated in both Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- cells, and we found that Tsc1 is required for TGF-β induced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and subsequent expression of the HH signaling effector and transcription factor GLI2. Hedgehog signaling was restored in Tsc1-/- cells after exogenous expression of Gli2, whereas rapamycin restored HH signaling in Tsc2-/- cells. Furthermore, we observed that Tsc1-/- MEFs display significantly elongated cilia, whereas cilia in Tsc2-/- MEFs were shorter than normal. The elongated cilium phenotype of Tsc1-/- MEFs is likely due to increased mTORC1-dependent autophagic flux observed in these cells, as both the autophagic flux and the cilia length phenotype was restored by rapamycin. In addition, ciliary length control in Tsc1-/- MEFs was also influenced by reduced expression of Gli2, which compromised expression of Wnt5a that normally promotes cilia disassembly. In summary, our results support distinct functions of Tsc1 and Tsc2 in cellular signaling as the two genes affect ciliary length control and HH signaling via different mechanisms.",

Somatostatin mRNA and plasma levels markedly increased. Neurogenin3-Tsc1-/- mice fed standard chow demonstrated a significant improvement in glucose tolerance and no alteration in insulin sensitivity. In Neurogenin3-Tsc1-/- mice fed 45% high-fat diets, both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were significantly impaired. Rapamycin reversed the activation of mTORC1, attenuated β cells hypertrophy and abolished the improvement of glucose tolerance.

    "abstract": "Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 causes tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) via activation of mTOR signaling pathway. The two prominent features of TSC are skin lesions including hypomelanic macules and benign tumors in multiple organs, whose molecular alterations are largely unknown. We report here that Xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) was elevated in Tsc2-/- or Pten-/- cells, Tsc1 knockout mouse tissues and TSC2-deficient human kidney tumor. xCT was transcriptionally boosted by mTOR-mediated Oct1 signaling cascade. Augmented xCT led to reduction of eumelanin and elevation of pheomelanin in Tsc1 skin knockout mice through mTOR signaling pathway. Disruption of xCT suppressed the proliferation and tumorigenesis of Pten-null cells and Tsc2-null cells. mTOR hyperactive cells were more sensitive to inhibitors of mTOR or xCT. Combined inhibition of mTOR and xCT synergistically blocked the propagation and oncogenesis of mTOR hyperactive cells. Therefore, oncogenic mTOR activation of xCT is a key connection between aberrant melanin synthesis and tumorigenesis. We suggest that xCT is a novel therapeutic target for TSC and other aberrant mTOR-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The downstream effector of PI3K, Akt, is frequently hyperactivated in human cancers. A critical downstream effector of Akt, which contributes to tumorigenesis, is mTOR. In the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, Akt is flanked by two tumor suppressors: PTEN, acting as a brake upstream of Akt, and TSC1/TSC2 heterodimer, acting as a brake downstream of Akt and upstream of mTOR. In the absence of the TSC1/TSC2 brake, mTOR activity is unleashed to inhibit Akt via an inhibitory feedback mechanism. Two recent studies used mouse genetics to assess the roles of PTEN and TSC2 in cancer, underscoring the importance of Akt-mTOR interplay for cancer progression and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is associated with poor prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer. The TSC1-TSC2 complex is a critical negative regulator of mTOR signaling. Here, we demonstrated that TSC1 was frequently downregulated in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and low TSC1 expression level is associated with advanced tumor stage. We next identified miR-130a to be a negative regulator of TSC1 by targeting its 3'UTR. miR-130a was overexpressed in HGSOC and could drive proliferation and invasion/metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. miR-130a could also attenuate rapamycin/starvation-induced autophagy. Ectopic TSC1 expression could block the effects of miR-130a on cell proliferation, migration and autophagy. Finally, we found that miR-130a expression could be upregulated by inflammatory factors and was transactivated by NF-κB. Therefore, our findings establish a crosstalk between inflammation and mTOR signaling that is mediated by miR-130a, which might have a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "T Follicular helper (Tfh) cells promote germinal center (GC) B cell responses to develop effective humoral immunity against pathogens. However, dysregulated Tfh cells can also trigger autoantibody production and the development of autoimmune diseases. We report here that Tsc1, a regulator for mTOR signaling, plays differential roles in Tfh cell/GC B cell responses in the steady state and in immune responses to antigen immunization. In the steady state, Tsc1 in T cells intrinsically suppresses spontaneous GC-Tfh cell differentiation and subsequent GC-B cell formation and autoantibody production. In immune responses to antigen immunization, Tsc1 in T cells is required for efficient GC-Tfh cell expansion, GC-B cell induction, and antigen-specific antibody responses, at least in part via promoting GC-Tfh cell mitochondrial integrity and survival. Interestingly, in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice reconstituted with both wild-type and T cell-specific Tsc1-deficient bone marrow cells, Tsc1 deficiency leads to enhanced GC-Tfh cell differentiation of wild-type CD4 T cells and increased accumulation of wild-type T regulatory cells and T follicular regulatory cells. Such bystander GC-Tfh cell differentiation suggests a potential mechanism that could trigger self-reactive GC-Tfh cell/GC responses and autoimmunity via neighboring GC-Tfh cells.",

    "abstract": "The molecular signature underlying autism spectrum disorder remains largely unknown. This study identifies differential expression of mTOR and MAPK pathways in patients affected by mild and severe idiopathic autism. A total of 55 subjects were enrolled, of which 22 were typically developing individuals and 33 were patients aged between 3 and 11 years, with autism spectrum disorder. A detailed history, including physical examination, developmental evaluation, mental health history and autism diagnostic observation schedule were performed for each patient. Components of the mTOR and MAPK signalling pathways were analysed from peripheral blood at the protein level. Patients were then stratified according to their clinical phenotypes, and the molecular profiling was analysed in relation to the degree of autism severity. In this cohort of patients, we identified increased activity of mTOR and the MAPK pathways, key regulators of synaptogenesis and protein synthesis. Specifically, rpS6, p-eIF4E, TSC1 and p-MNK1 expression discriminated patients according to their clinical diagnosis, suggesting that components of protein synthesis signalling pathways might constitute a molecular signature of clinical severity in autism spectrum disorder.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver. The affected genes are TSC1 and TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin respectively. The hamartin-tuberin complex inhibits the mammalian-target-of-Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which controls cell growth and proliferation. Variations in the distribution, number, size, and location of lesions cause the clinical syndrome to vary even between relatives. About 85% of children and adolescents with TSC have CNS complications, including epilepsy, cognitive impairment, challenging behavioral problems, and autism-like symptoms. Epilepsy generally begins during the first year of life, with focal seizures and spasms. The discovery of the mTOR pathway upregulation in TSC-associated lesions presents new possibilities for treatment strategy. Increasing understanding of the molecular abnormalities caused by TSC may enable improved management of the disease.",

    "pages": "372-85",
    "abstract": "Throughout the globe, diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing in incidence with limited therapies presently available to prevent or resolve the significant complications of this disorder. DM impacts multiple organs and affects all components of the central and peripheral nervous systems that can range from dementia to diabetic neuropathy. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a promising agent for the development of novel regenerative strategies for the treatment of DM. mTOR and its related signaling pathways impact multiple metabolic parameters that include cellular metabolic homeostasis, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, stem cell proliferation and differentiation, pancreatic β-cell function, and programmed cell death with apoptosis and autophagy. mTOR is central element for the protein complexes mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) and is a critical component for a number of signaling pathways that involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K), protein kinase B (Akt), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), and growth factors. As a result, mTOR represents an exciting target to offer new clinical avenues for the treatment of DM and the complications of this disease. Future studies directed to elucidate the delicate balance mTOR holds over cellular metabolism and the impact of its broad signaling pathways should foster the translation of these targets into effective clinical regimens for DM.",

    "issue": "7()",
    "pages": "18",
    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates a variety of neuronal functions, including cell proliferation, survival, growth, and plasticity. Dysregulation of the pathway is implicated in the development of both genetic and acquired epilepsies. Indeed, several causal mutations have been identified in patients with epilepsy, the most prominent of these being mutations in PTEN and tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). These genes act as negative regulators of mTOR signaling, and mutations lead to hyperactivation of the pathway. Animal models deleting PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 consistently produce epilepsy phenotypes, demonstrating that increased mTOR signaling can provoke neuronal hyperexcitability. Given the broad range of changes induced by altered mTOR signaling, however, the mechanisms underlying seizure development in these animals remain uncertain. In transgenic mice, cell populations with hyperactive mTOR have many structural abnormalities that support recurrent circuit formation, including somatic and dendritic hypertrophy, aberrant basal dendrites, and enlargement of axon tracts. At the functional level, mTOR hyperactivation is commonly, but not always, associated with enhanced synaptic transmission and plasticity. Moreover, these populations of abnormal neurons can affect the larger network, inducing secondary changes that may explain paradoxical findings reported between cell and network functioning in different models or at different developmental time points. Here, we review the animal literature examining the link between mTOR hyperactivation and epileptogenesis, emphasizing the impact of enhanced mTOR signaling on neuronal form and function.",

    "issue": "100(3)",
    "pages": "454-472",
    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of the sporadic form of intractable focal epilepsies that require surgical treatment. It has recently been reported that brain somatic mutations in MTOR account for 15%-25% of FCD type II (FCDII), characterized by cortical dyslamination and dysmorphic neurons. However, the genetic etiologies of FCDII-affected individuals who lack the MTOR mutation remain unclear. Here, we performed deep hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing (read depth of 100×-20,012×) of five important mTOR pathway genes-PIK3CA, PIK3R2, AKT3, TSC1, and TSC2-by using paired brain and saliva samples from 40 FCDII individuals negative for MTOR mutations. We found that 5 of 40 individuals (12.5%) had brain somatic mutations in TSC1 (c.64C>T [p.Arg22Trp] and c.610C>T [p.Arg204Cys]) and TSC2 (c.4639G>A [p.Val1547Ile]), and these results were reproducible on two different sequencing platforms. All identified mutations induced hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by disrupting the formation or function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. Furthermore, in utero CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing of Tsc1 or Tsc2 induced the development of spontaneous behavioral seizures, as well as cytomegalic neurons and cortical dyslamination. These results show that brain somatic mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 cause FCD and that in utero application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is useful for generating neurodevelopmental disease models of somatic mutations in the brain.",

    "title": "IKBKE inhibits TSC1 to activate the mTOR/S6K pathway for oncogenic transformation.",
    "issue": "42(4)",
    "pages": "268-278",
    "abstract": "IKBKE (IKKε) has emerged as a key modulator of multiple substrates, controlling oncogenic pathways in various malignancies. mTOR signaling, required for cellular growth, proliferation, and vascular angiogenesis in cancer, is potentially one of the pathways regulated by IKKε. Upon activation by various stimuli, PI3K/AKT or similar effectors can relieve the inhibitory effect of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through their phosphorylation to favor mTOR/S6K activation in the downstream. Therefore, any activity that interferes with PI3K/AKT or their downstream targets, such as TSC1/2 or GSK3α/β, may activate the mTOR/S6K pathway for oncogenic transformation in normal cells. Previous studies have shown that PI3K/AKT can be directly phosphoregulated by IKKε. Here, we propose a new regulatory function for IKKε in the mTOR/S6K pathway through its direct interaction with TSC1, leading to TSC1 phosphorylation, which is vital to suppress its inhibitory role in mTOR activation. Experimentally, upon IKKε deficiency in colorectal cancer cells, we observed that S6K activity was diminished while TSC1 levels were found to be stabilized. We hypothesized that these observations may result from direct interaction between IKKε and TSC1. Indeed, the interaction of these two proteins involves the phosphoregulation of TSC1 in various cell lines. Therefore, we propose a mechanism where IKKε, through regulating TSC1 stability in cancer cells, may create an alternative regulatory loop for the activation of mTOR signaling. These results can potentially be important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mTOR signaling.",

    "issue": "23(3)",
    "pages": "693-705",
    "abstract": "This is a study on the role of tuberous sclerosis complex1 (TSC1) mutation and mTOR activation in endothelial cells during angiogenic and embryonic development. Past studies had shown that Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant genes lead to overactivation of mTOR in the regulating pathways in developing fetus. We used conditional Cre-loxp gene knockout approach to delete Tsc1 in mice's endothelial cells in our experimental models. Similarly, activation of mTOR signaling in endothelial cells of these embryos (Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-)) was found. Majority of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos died at embryonic day 14.5 in utero. Cardiovascular defects, subcutaneous edema and hemorrhage were present among them. Whole-mount immunostaining in these embryos revealed a disorganized vascular network, defective sprouting of vessels in yolk sac and thickening of the labyrinth layer in the placenta. A thinner ventricular wall with disorganized trabeculae was present in the hearts of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos. Endothelial cells in Tsc1-deficient mice showed defective mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticular morphology, but no significant change was observed in cell junctions. The mutant embryos displayed significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and disturbed expression of angiogenic factors. A cohort of mice was treated prenatally with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The offspring of these mutant mice survived up to 22 days after birth. It was concluded that physiological TSC1-mTOR signaling in endothelial cells is crucial for vascular development and embryogenesis. We postulated that disruption of normal angiogenic pathways through hyperactive mTOR signaling maybe the mechanism that lead to deranged vascular pathogenesis in the tuberous sclerosis complex.",

    "issue": "207(8)",
    "pages": "2039-2050",
    "abstract": "Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are critical for the development and generation of functionally competent T cells. Until now, the mechanism that regulates the survival of TECs is poorly understood. In the current study, we found that Tsc1 controls the homeostasis of medullary TECs (mTECs) by inhibiting lysosomal-mediated apoptosis pathway in mice. TEC-specific deletion of Tsc1 predominately decreased the cell number of mTECs and, to a lesser content, affected the development cortical TECs. The defect of mTECs caused by Tsc1 deficiency in mice impaired thymocyte development and peripheral T cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, Tsc1 deficiency did not affect the cell proliferation of mTECs but increased the apoptosis of mTECs significantly. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that pathways involved in lysosomal biogenesis, cell metabolism, and apoptosis were remarkably elevated in Tsc1-deficient mTECs compared with their wild-type counterparts. Tsc1-deficient mTECs exhibited overproduction of reactive oxygen species and malfunction of lysosome, with lysosome membrane permeabilization and the release of cathepsin B and cathepsin L to the cytosol, which then lead to Bid cleaved into active truncated Bid and subsequently intrinsic apoptosis. Finally, we showed that the impaired development of mTECs could be partially reversed by decreasing mTORC1 activity via haploinsufficiency of Raptor Thus, Tsc1 is essential for the homeostasis of mTECs by inhibiting lysosomal-mediated apoptosis through mTORC1-dependent pathways.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant or sporadic multisystem disorder that results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. The primary organs affected include the brain, skin, lung, kidney, and heart, all with variable frequency, penetrance, and severity. There are over 2000 known allelic variants for TSC, including nonsense and misssense mutation, and all pathogenic mutations are inactivating, leading to loss-of-function effects on the encoded proteins, TSC1 and TSC2. These proteins form a complex to constitutively inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and as a consequence, mTOR signaling is constitutively active within all TSC-associated lesions. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus have been shown to reduce renal and brain lesion size, and improve pulmonary function in TSC, and these compounds may also decrease seizure frequency. The clinical application of mTOR inhibitors in TSC has provided one of the first examples of precision medicine in a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in pulmonary fibrosis was investigated in cell and animal models. mTOR overactivation in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) was achieved in the conditional and inducible Tsc1 knock-down mice SPC-rtTA/TetO-Cre/Tsc1(fx/+) (STT). Doxycycline caused Tsc1 knock-down and consequently mTOR activation in AECs for the STT mice. Mice treated with bleomycin exhibited increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis compared with control mice. In wild-type C57BL/6J mice, pretreatment with rapamycin attenuated the bleomycin-mediated mortality and fibrosis. Rapamycin-mediated mouse survival benefit was inhibited by chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. Autophagosomes were decreased in the lungs after bleomycin exposure. Rapamycin induced the production of autophagosomes and diminished p62. We concluded that mTOR overactivation in AECs and compromised autophagy in the lungs are involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The suppression of mTOR and enhancement of autophagy may be used for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Proper peripheral myelination depends upon the balance between Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation programs. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR integrates various environmental cues to serve as a central regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and function. We report here that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), a negative regulator of mTOR activity, establishes a stage-dependent program for Schwann cell lineage progression and myelination by controlling cell proliferation and myelin homeostasis. Tsc1 ablation in Schwann cell progenitors in mice resulted in activation of mTOR signaling, and caused over-proliferation of Schwann cells and blocked their differentiation, leading to hypomyelination. Transcriptome profiling analysis revealed that mTOR activation in Tsc1 mutants resulted in upregulation of a polo-like kinase (PLK)-dependent pathway and cell cycle regulators. Attenuation of mTOR or pharmacological inhibition of polo-like kinases partially rescued hypomyelination caused by Tsc1 loss in the developing peripheral nerves. In contrast, deletion of Tsc1 in mature Schwann cells led to redundant and overgrown myelin sheaths in adult mice. Together, our findings indicate stage-specific functions for the TSC1-mTOR-PLK signaling axis in controlling the transition from proliferation to differentiation and myelin homeostasis during Schwann cell development.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial molecule in the control of cell size and proliferation; dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is commonly found in human cancers. Many cancer-promoting kinases have been identified as regulators of mTOR activity through phosphorylation and inactivation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. Tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) are tumor-promoting factors in inflammation-mediated tumor development, and the signaling molecules involved in TAMs-mediated tumor angiogenesis are not well understood. Therefore, it is urgent to elucidate the cross-talk between inflammatory cells and cancers and to explore the precise pathways involved in TAMsinduced tumor angiogenesis. Recently IKKbeta was found to activate the mTOR pathway and to promote tumor angiogenesis through inactivation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex by phosphorylating TSC1. This finding provides critical insights into and suggests one mechanism behind inflammation-mediated tumor angiogenesis. In this extra-view, we briefly discuss the possible influence of TAMs-released proangiogenic factors on mTOR activation and propose a model of the cross-talk between tumors and TAMs in tumor angiogenesis.",

    "issue": "7()",
    "pages": "1",
    "abstract": "The Pten and Tsc1 genes both encode proteins that repress mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Disruption of either gene in the brain results in epilepsy and autism-like symptoms in humans and mouse models, therefore it is important to understand the molecular and physiological events that lead from gene disruption to disease phenotypes. Given the similar roles these two molecules play in the regulation of cellular growth and the overlap in the phenotypes that result from their loss, we predicted that the deletion of either the Pten or Tsc1 gene from autaptic hippocampal neurons would have similar effects on neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission. Accordingly, we found that loss of either Pten or Tsc1 caused comparable increases in soma size, dendrite length and action potential properties. However, the effects of Pten and Tsc1 loss on synaptic transmission were different. Loss of Pten lead to an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, while loss of Tsc1 did not affect excitatory neurotransmission and reduced inhibitory transmission by decreasing mIPSC amplitude. Although the loss of Pten or Tsc1 both increased downstream mTORC1 signaling, phosphorylation of Akt was increased in Pten-ko and decreased in Tsc1-ko neurons, potentially accounting for the different effects on synaptic transmission. Despite the different effects at the synaptic level, our data suggest that loss of Pten or Tsc1 may both lead to an increase in the ratio of excitation to inhibition at the network level, an effect that has been proposed to underlie both epilepsy and autism.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, which encode negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. The renal abnormalities associated with TSC include angiomyolipoma, cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. Here we report that specific ablation of Tsc1 using the mesenchymal stem cell-osteoblast lineage markers induced cystogenesis in mice. Using Rosa-tdTomato mice, we found that Prx1- or Dermo1-labeled cells were present in the nephron including glomerulus but they were not stained by markers for podocytes, mesangial cells, endothelial cells, or proximal or loop of Henle tubular cells, while Osx is known to label tubular cells. Tsc1 deficiency in Prx1 lineage cells caused development of mild cysts that were positive only for Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), a loop of Henle marker, while Tsc1 deficiency in Osx lineage cells caused development of cysts that were positive for Villin, a proximal tubular cell marker. On the other hand, Tsc1 deficiency in the Dermo1 lineage did not produce detectable phenotypical changes in the kidney. Cyst formation in Prx1-Cre; Tsc1f/f and Osx-Cre; Tsc1f/f mice were associated with increase in both proliferative and apoptotic cells in the affected tissue and were largely suppressed by rapamycin. These results suggest that Prx1 and Osx lineages cells may contribute to renal cystogenesis in TSC patients.",

    "title": "Loss of FOXP3 and TSC1 Accelerates Prostate Cancer Progression through Synergistic Transcriptional and Posttranslational Regulation of c-MYC.",
    "issue": "79(7)",
    "pages": "1413-1425",
    "abstract": "Although c-MYC and mTOR are frequently activated proteins in prostate cancer, any interaction between the two is largely untested. Here, we characterize the functional cross-talk between FOXP3-c-MYC and TSC1-mTOR signaling during tumor progression. Deletion of Tsc1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) decreased phosphorylation of c-MYC at threonine 58 (pT58) and increased phosphorylation at serine 62 (pS62), an observation validated in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, inhibition of mTOR increased pT58 but decreased pS62. Loss of both FOXP3 and TSC1 in prostate cancer cells synergistically enhanced c-MYC expression via regulation of c-Myc transcription and protein phosphorylation. This crosstalk between FOXP3 and TSC1 appeared to be mediated by both the mTOR-4EBP1-c-MYC and FOXP3-c-MYC pathways. In mice, Tsc1 and Foxp3 double deletions in the prostate led to prostate carcinomas at an early age; this did not occur in these mice with an added c-Myc deletion. In addition, we observed synergistic antitumor effects of cotreating mice with inhibitors of mTOR and c-MYC in prostate cancer cells and in Foxp3 and Tsc1 double-mutant mice. In human prostate cancer, loss of nuclear FOXP3 is often accompanied by low expression of TSC1. Because loss of FOXP3 transcriptionally induces c-Myc expression and loss of TSC1 activates mTOR signaling, these data suggest cross-talk between FOXP3-c-MYC and TSC1-mTOR signaling that converges on c-MYC to regulate tumor progression. Coadministration of c-MYC and mTOR inhibitors may overcome the resistance to mTOR inhibition commonly observed in prostate cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These results establish the principle of a synergistic action of TSC1 and FOXP3 during prostate cancer progression and provide new therapeutic targets for patients who have prostate cancer with two signaling defects.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/7/1413/F1.large.jpg.",

    "pages": "217-228",
    "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis has been characterized by abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts and massive deposition of the extracellular matrix, which results from a complex interplay of chronic injury and inflammatory responses. MicroRNA-301a (miR-301a) is activated by multiple inflammatory stimulators, contributing to multiple tumorigenesis and autoimmune diseases. This study showed that miR-301a was overexpressed in a bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In addition, miR-301a was activated by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in normal and IPF fibroblasts, which was markedly reversed by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor. The genetic ablation of miR-301a in mice reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, and the downregulation of miR-301a restrained proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that TSC1 was a functional target of miR-301a in fibroblasts, and the negative regulation of TSC1 by miR-301a promoted the severity of pulmonary fibrosis through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The blocking of miR-301a by the intravenous injection of antagomiR-301a inhibited the proliferation of fibroblasts and the structural destruction of lung tissues in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model. The findings revealed the crucial role of the miR-301a/TSC1/mTOR axis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that miR-301a might serve as a potential therapeutic target.",

    "title": "A complex interplay between Akt, TSC2 and the two mTOR complexes.",
    "issue": "37(Pt 1)",
    "pages": "217-22",
    "abstract": "Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) both regulates and is regulated by the TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex) 1-TSC2 complex. Downstream of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), Akt phosphorylates TSC2 directly on multiple sites. Although the molecular mechanism is not well understood, these phosphorylation events relieve the inhibitory effects of the TSC1-TSC2 complex on Rheb and mTORC1 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex] 1, thereby activating mTORC1 in response to growth factors. Through negative-feedback mechanisms, mTORC1 activity inhibits growth factor stimulation of PI3K. This is particularly evident in cells and tumours lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex, where Akt signalling is severely attenuated due, at least in part, to constitutive activation of mTORC1. An additional level of complexity in the relationship between Akt and the TSC1-TSC2 complex has recently been uncovered. The growth-factor-stimulated kinase activity of mTORC2 [also known as the mTOR-rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) complex], which normally enhances Akt signalling by phosphorylating its hydrophobic motif (Ser(473)), was found to be defective in cells lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex. This effect on mTORC2 can be separated from the inhibitory effects of the TSC1-TSC2 complex on Rheb and mTORC1. The present review discusses our current understanding of the increasingly complex functional interactions between Akt, the TSC1-TSC2 complex and mTOR, which are fundamentally important players in a large variety of human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived somatostatin (SST)+ and parvalbumin (PV)+ cortical interneurons (CINs), have characteristic molecular, anatomical and physiological properties. However, mechanisms regulating their diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we show that conditional loss of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) gene, Tsc1, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), causes a subset of SST+ CINs, to express PV and adopt fast-spiking (FS) properties, characteristic of PV+ CINs. Milder intermediate phenotypes also occur when only one allele of Tsc1 is deleted. Notably, treatment of adult mice with rapamycin, which inhibits MTOR, reverses the phenotypes. These data reveal novel functions of MTOR signaling in regulating PV expression and FS properties, which may contribute to TSC neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, they suggest that CINs can exhibit properties intermediate between those classically associated with PV+ or SST+ CINs, which may be dynamically regulated by the MTOR signaling.",

    "title": "IKK beta suppression of TSC1 links inflammation and tumor angiogenesis via the mTOR pathway.",
    "issue": "130(3)",
    "pages": "440-55",
    "abstract": "TNFalpha has recently emerged as a regulator linking inflammation to cancer pathogenesis, but the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this link remain to be elucidated. The tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex serves as a repressor of the mTOR pathway, and disruption of TSC1/TSC2 complex function may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show that IKKbeta, a major downstream kinase in the TNFalpha signaling pathway, physically interacts with and phosphorylates TSC1 at Ser487 and Ser511, resulting in suppression of TSC1. The IKKbeta-mediated TSC1 suppression activates the mTOR pathway, enhances angiogenesis, and results in tumor development. We further find that expression of activated IKKbeta is associated with TSC1 Ser511 phosphorylation and VEGF production in multiple tumor types and correlates with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer patients. Our findings identify a pathway that is critical for inflammation-mediated tumor angiogenesis and may provide a target for clinical intervention in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic renal neoplasms have a wide spectrum of histologic presentations, and several studies have demonstrated a subtype of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. A review of our institutional archives led to the identification of 18 cases of renal eosinophilic tumors with unusual morphology. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that these could be separated into 3 groups: group 1 had solid architecture and morphology similar to chromophobe RCC but was negative for CK20 and vimentin, and had weak focal staining for CK7 and P504S; group 2 had solid architecture and morphology similar to either renal oncocytoma or chromophobe RCC, eosinophilic variant and had diffuse staining of CK7 and P504S, absent to weak staining of CK20, and negative staining for vimentin; and group 3 had solid, cystic and papillary architecture and was negative for CK7, except for 1 case, along with moderate to strong staining of CK20, P504S, and vimentin. The cases were then sent for next-generation sequencing to determine whether molecular pathogenic variants were present. In group 1, all 3 cases had mutations in TSC2. In group 2, pathogenic variants were identified in 3 genes: TSC1, TSC2, and MTOR. In group 3, genetic alterations and pathogenic variants were identified in TSC1 and TSC2. Our results support TSC/MTOR-associated neoplasms as a distinct group that exhibits heterogenous morphology and immunohistochemical staining.",

    "pages": "861-8",
    "abstract": "TSC1 acts coordinately with TSC2 in a complex to inhibit mTOR, an emerging therapeutic target and known promoter of cell growth and cell cycle progression. Perturbation of the mTOR pathway, through abnormal expression or function of pathway genes, could lead to tumorigenesis. TSC1 and TSC2 expression is reduced in invasive breast cancer as compared with normal mammary epithelium. Because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory genes have been implicated in risk and age at diagnosis of breast cancers, systematic SNP association studies were performed on TSC1 and TSC2 SNPs for their associations with clinical features of breast cancer. TSC1 and TSC2 haplotypes were constructed from genotyping of multiple loci in both genes in healthy volunteers. SNPs were selected for further study using a bioinformatics approach based on SNP associations with drug response in NCI-60 cell lines and evidence of selection bias based on haplotype frequencies. Genotyping for five TSC1 and one TSC2 loci were performed on genomic DNA from 1,137 women with breast cancer. This study found that for TSC1 rs7874234, TT variant carriers had a 9-year later age at diagnosis of estrogen receptor positive (ER+), but not ER-, ductal carcinomas (P = 0.0049). No other SNP locus showed an association with age at diagnosis, nor any other breast cancer phenotype. TSC1 rs7874234 is hypothesized to be functional in ER+ breast cancer because the T allele, but not the C allele, may create an estrogen receptor element (ERE) site, resulting in increased TSC1 transcription and subsequent inhibition of mTOR.",

    "issue": "7(32)",
    "pages": "52239-52254",
    "abstract": "VPS34 is reported to activate S6K1 and is implicated in regulating cell growth, the mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we describe novel mechanisms by which VPS34 upregulates mTOR/S6K1 activity via downregulating TSC2 protein and activating RheB activity. Specifically, upregulation of VPS34 lipid kinase increases local production of ptdins(3)p in the plasma membrane, which recruits PIKFYVE, a FYVE domain containing protein, to ptdins(3)p enriched regions of the plasma membrane, where VPS34 forms a protein complex with PIKFYVE and TSC1. This in turn disengages TSC2 from the TSC1/TSC2 heterodimer, leading to TSC2 ubiquitination and degradation. Downregulation of TSC2 promotes the activation of RheB and mTOR/S6K1. When VPS34 lipid kinase activity is increased by introduction of an H868R mutation, ptdins(3)p production at the plasma membrane is dramatically increased, which recruits more PIKFYVE and TSC1 molecules to the plasma membrane. This results in the enhanced TSC2 ubiquitination and degradation, and subsequent activation of RheB and mTORC1/S6K1, leading to oncogenic transformation. The role played by VPS34 in regulating mTOR/S6K1 activity and cellular transformation is underscored by the fact that the VPS34 kinase dead mutant blocks VPS34-induced recruitment of PIKFYVE and TSC1 to the plasma membrane. This study provides mechanistic insight into the cellular function of VPS34 in regulating oncogenic transformation and important indications for identifying VPS34 specific mutations in human cancers.",

    "issue": "18(23)",
    "pages": "2893-904",
    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of protein synthesis whose activity is modulated by a variety of signals. Energy depletion and hypoxia result in mTOR inhibition. While energy depletion inhibits mTOR through a process involving the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by LKB1 and subsequent phosphorylation of TSC2, the mechanism of mTOR inhibition by hypoxia is not known. Here we show that mTOR inhibition by hypoxia requires the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1/RTP801. Disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on mTOR, as measured by changes in the mTOR targets S6K and 4E-BP1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). In contrast to energy depletion, mTOR inhibition by hypoxia does not require AMPK or LKB1. Down-regulation of mTOR activity by hypoxia requires de novo mRNA synthesis and correlates with increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible REDD1 gene. Disruption of REDD1 abrogates the hypoxia-induced inhibition of mTOR, and REDD1 overexpression is sufficient to down-regulate S6K phosphorylation in a TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. Inhibition of mTOR function by hypoxia is likely to be important for tumor suppression as TSC2-deficient cells maintain abnormally high levels of cell proliferation under hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a familial tumor syndrome due to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, in which progression to malignancy is rare. Primary Tsc2(-/-) murine embryo fibroblast cultures display early senescence with overexpression of p21CIP1/WAF1 that is rescued by loss of TP53. Tsc2(-/-)TP53(-/-) cells, as well as tumors from Tsc2(+/-) mice, display an mTOR-activation signature with constitutive activation of S6K, which is reverted by treatment with rapamycin. Rapamycin also reverts a growth advantage of Tsc2(-/-)TP53(-/-) cells. Tsc1/Tsc2 does not bind directly to mTOR, however, nor does it directly influence mTOR kinase activity or cellular phosphatase activity. There is a marked reduction in Akt activation in Tsc2(-/-)TP53(-/-) and Tsc1(-/-) cells in response to serum and PDGF, along with a reduction in cell ruffling. PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta expression is markedly reduced in both the cell lines and Tsc mouse renal cystadenomas, and ectopic expression of PDGFRbeta in Tsc2-null cells restores Akt phosphorylation in response to serum, PDGF, EGF, and insulin. This activation of mTOR along with downregulation of PDGFR PI3K-Akt signaling in cells lacking Tsc1 or Tsc2 may explain why these genes are rarely involved in human cancer. This is in contrast to PTEN, which is a negative upstream regulator of this pathway.",

    "issue": "10()",
    "pages": "160",
    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to be closely related to the development of ALS. However, the precise functions of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of ALS remain largely unknown. In previous studies, we determined that miRNA-193b-3p was significantly downregulated in patients with sporadic ALS (sALS). Here, we observed that miRNA-193b-3p was downregulated in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS and promoted cell death in NSC-34 cells. We further found that miR-193b-3p directly targeted tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) to regulate mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Downregulation of miR-193b-3p led to TSC1 increase accompanied with mTORC1 inactivation, and vice versa. Moreover, downregulation of miR-193b-3p promoted protective autophagy and cell survival in NSC-34 cells. In contrast, upregulation of miR-193b-3p activated mTORC1 signaling, leading to inhibition of autophagy and promotion of cell death. Taken together, our study suggests that downregulation of miR-193b-3p is required for cell survival by targeting TSC1/mTOR signaling in NSC-34 cells and provides a novel target for improving the clinical therapy of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Male patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) have defective spermatogenesis and are at increased risk of developing Sertoli cell tumors. Mutations in the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) gene are associated with the pathogenesis of PJS and have been identified in non-PJS patients with sporadic testicular cancers. The mechanisms controlled by LKB1 signaling in Sertoli cell functions and testicular biology have not been described. We have conditionally deleted the Lkb1 gene (Lkb1(cko)) in somatic testicular cells to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the testicular phenotype observed in PJS patients. Focal vacuolization in some of the seminiferous tubules was observed in 4-week-old mutant testes but germ cell development appeared to be normal. However, similar to PJS patients, we observed progressive germ cell loss and Sertoli cell only tubules in Lkb1(cko) testes from mice older than 10 weeks, accompanied by defects in Sertoli cell polarity and testicular junctional complexes and decreased activation of the MAP/microtubule affinity regulating and focal adhesion kinases. Suppression of AMP kinase and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling were also observed in Lkb1(cko) testes. Loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 copies the progressive Lkb1(cko) phenotype, suggesting that dysregulated activation of mTOR contributes to the pathogenesis of the Lkb1(cko) testicular phenotype. Pten(cko) mice had a normal testicular phenotype, which could be explained by the comparative lack of mTOR activation detected. These studies describe the importance of LKB1 signaling in testicular biology and the possible molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of the testicular defects observed in PJS patients.",

The activity of mTOR is controlled not only by amino acids, but also by hormones and growth factors that activate the protein kinase Akt. The signaling pathway downstream of Akt leading to mTOR involves the protein products of the genes mutated in tuberous sclerosis, TSC1 and TSC2, and the small guanosine triphosphatase, Rheb. In cells, mTOR is found in a complex with two other proteins, raptor and mLST8. In this review, we describe recent progress in understanding the control of the mTOR signaling pathway and the role of mTOR-interacting proteins.",

    "issue": "22(2)",
    "pages": "239-51",
    "abstract": "Hypoxia induces rapid and dramatic changes in cellular metabolism, in part through inhibition of target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase complex 1 (TORC1) activity. Genetic studies have shown the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressors TSC1/2 and the REDD1 protein to be essential for hypoxia regulation of TORC1 activity in Drosophila and in mammalian cells. The molecular mechanism and physiologic significance of this effect of hypoxia remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia and REDD1 suppress mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) activity by releasing TSC2 from its growth factor-induced association with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. Endogenous REDD1 is required for both dissociation of endogenous TSC2/14-3-3 and inhibition of mTORC1 in response to hypoxia. REDD1 mutants that fail to bind 14-3-3 are defective in eliciting TSC2/14-3-3 dissociation and mTORC1 inhibition, while TSC2 mutants that do not bind 14-3-3 are inactive in hypoxia signaling to mTORC1. In vitro, loss of REDD1 signaling promotes proliferation and anchorage-independent growth under hypoxia through mTORC1 dysregulation. In vivo, REDD1 loss elicits tumorigenesis in a mouse model, and down-regulation of REDD1 is observed in a subset of human cancers. Together, these findings define a molecular mechanism of signal integration by TSC1/2 that provides insight into the ability of REDD1 to function in a hypoxia-dependent tumor suppressor pathway.",

We evaluate genetic variation in nine genes in a candidate pathway as follows: STK11 (3 tagSNPs), PTEN (9 tagSNPs), FRAP1 (mTOR) (4 tagSNPs), TSC1 (14 tagSNPs), TSC2 (8 tagSNPs), Akt1 (2 tagSNPs), PIK3CA (7 tagSNPs), PRKAA1 (13 tagSNPs) and PRKAG2 (68 tagSNPs) in two population-based case-control studies of colon (n = 1574 cases, 1940 controls) and rectal (n = 91 cases, 999 controls) cancer. FRAP1, PRKAA1, PRKAG2 and TSC2 genes were significantly associated with colon cancer; risk estimates ranged from 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.38] for FRAP1rs1057079 for the AG/GG genotype to 1.51 (95% CI 1.09-2.09) for PRKAG2rs9648723 CC genotype. PIK3CA, PRKAG2, PTEN, STK11 and TSC1 were significantly associated with rectal cancer overall. The strongest association was observed for PIK3CA rs7651265 GG genotype (odds ratio 2.32 95% CI 1.02-5.30). FRAP1 was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI)+ colon tumors; PRKAA1, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)+ and MSI+ colon tumors; PRKAG2 and KRAS2 colon tumors; TSC1 and CIMP+ and MSI+ colon tumors; TSC2 with MSI+ colon tumors; PIK3CA with KRAS2-mutated rectal tumors; PRKAG2 (rs6964824) with KRAS2- and TP53-mutated rectal tumors and with PRKAG2 (rs412396 and rs4725431) with CIMP+ rectal tumors. These data suggest that genetic variation in a predefined candidate pathway for colorectal cancer contributes to both colon and rectal cancer risk. Associations appear to be strongest for CIMP+ and MSI+ tumors.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes and obesity are commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence show that insulin signaling defects are protentional upstream driver of AD. However, the mechanism by which diabetes and insulin signaling defects contribute to AD remains unknown. Here we show that Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is involved the insulin defects-associated AD. Defective insulin signaling in diabetes and obesity in human and mice activated Fto in the brain tissues. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Fto reduced the phosphorylation of Tau protein whereas overexpression of FTO promoted the level of phosphorylated Tau in neurons. Mechanism study demonstrated that FTO activated the phosphorylation of Tau in a mTOR-dependent manner because FTO activated mTOR and its downstream signaling and rapamycin blocked FTO-mediated phosphorylation of Tau. FTO promoted the activation of mTOR by increasing the mRNA level of TSC1 but not TSC2, the upstream inhibitor of mTOR. Finally, we found that conditional knockout of Fto in the neurons reduced the cognitive deficits in 3xTg AD mice. Collectively, our evidence demonstrated that FTO is critically involved in insulin defects-related AD.",

    "abstract": "AIMS\nTo determine the significance of the epithelioid type and the corresponding molecular alterations in hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe retrieved 24 samples of hepatic AML to delineate the clinicopathological features and the immunohistochemical expression of components in the mTOR pathway, and employed microsatellite markers to analyse allelic imbalances in the TSC1 and TSC2 regions. Myomatous AML was the most common type, and a predominantly epithelioid cell population was observed in 50% of the samples. Two-thirds of all samples contained <20% of fat tissue. Four cases of monotypic epithelioid AML were discovered without prognostic implications. Elevated phospho-p70S6 kinase expression was noted in 19 samples in the absence of phospho-AKT activity. Loss of heterogeneity (LOH) of TSC1/TSC2 was found in 15 samples. As compared wityh syndromic AML samples, sporadic AML samples showed LOH of microsatellite markers to a limited extent. Only four samples had increased β-catenin expression in the context of concurrent high expression of phospho-p70S6 kinase and phospho-S6 (P = 0.018).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe low fat content and epithelioid cytomorphology in hepatic AML potentially obstruct preoperative and pathological diagnosis. Alteration of the mTOR pathway and LOH of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes is a frequent pathogenesis in hepatic AMLs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase-B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is a fundamental regulator of cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulation in this pathway leads to the development of cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulation in this pathway is involved in cancer initiation, progression, and recurrence. However, the pathway consists of various signal transducing factors related with cellular events, such as transformation, tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, it is very important to determine the targets in this pathway for cancer therapy. Although many drugs inhibiting this signaling pathway are in clinical trials or have been approved for treating solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, further understanding of the signaling mechanism is required to achieve better therapeutic efficacy.Areas covered: In this review, we have describe the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in detail, along with its critical role in cancer stem cells, for identifying potential therapeutic targets. We also summarize the recent developments in different types of signaling inhibitors.Expert opinion: Downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is very important for treating all types of cancers. Thus, further studies are required to establish novel prognostic factors to support the current progress in cancer treatment with emphasis on this pathway.",

    "pages": "1496-1506",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe investigated the mutational landscape of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling cascade in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with chronic HBV background, aiming to evaluate and delineate mutation-dependent mechanism of mTOR hyperactivation in hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe performed next-generation sequencing on human HCC samples and cell line panel. Systematic mutational screening of mTOR pathway-related genes was undertaken and mutant genes were evaluated based on their recurrence. Protein expressions of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1, TSC2 and pRPS6 were assessed by immunohistochemistry in human HCC samples. Rapamycin sensitivity was estimated by colony-formation assay in HCC cell lines and the treatment was further tested using our patient-derived tumour xenograft (PDTX) models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified and confirmed multiple mTOR components as recurrently mutated in HBV-associated HCCs. Of significance, we detected frequent (16.2%, n=18/111) mutations of TSC1 and TSC2 genes in the HCC samples. The spectrum of TSC1/2 mutations likely disrupts the endogenous gene functions in suppressing the downstream mTOR activity through different mechanisms and leads to more aggressive tumour behaviour. Mutational disruption of TSC1 and TSC2 was also observed in HCC cell lines and our PDTX models. TSC-mutant cells exhibited reduced colony-forming ability on rapamycin treatment. With the use of biologically relevant TSC2-mutant PDTXs, we demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of the hypersensitivity towards rapamycin treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, our findings suggest the significance of previously undocumented mutation-dependent mTOR hyperactivation and frequent TSC1/2 mutations in HBV-associated HCCs. They define a molecular subset of HCC having genetic aberrations in mTOR signalling, with potential significance of effective specific drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 and TSC2 mutations cause neoplasms in rare disease pulmonary LAM and neuronal pathfinding in hamartoma syndrome TSC. The specific roles of TSC1 and TSC2 in actin remodeling and the modulation of cell motility, however, are not well understood. Previously, we demonstrated that TSC1 and TSC2 regulate the activity of small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, stress fiber formation and cell adhesion in a reciprocal manner. Here, we show that Tsc1(-/-) MEFs have decreased migration compared to littermate-derived Tsc1(+/+) MEFs. Migration of Tsc1(-/-) MEFs with re-expressed TSC1 was comparable to Tsc1(+/+) MEF migration. In contrast, Tsc2(-/-) MEFs showed an increased migration compared to Tsc2(+/+) MEFs that were abrogated by TSC2 re-expression. Depletion of TSC1 and TSC2 using specific siRNAs in wild type MEFs and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts also showed that TSC1 loss attenuates cell migration while TSC2 loss promotes cell migration. Morphological and immunochemical analysis demonstrated that Tsc1(-/-) MEFs have a thin protracted shape with a few stress fibers; in contrast, Tsc2(-/-) MEFs showed a rounded morphology and abundant stress fibers. Expression of TSC1 in either Tsc1(-/-) or Tsc2(-/-) MEFs promoted stress fiber formation, while TSC2 re-expression induced stress fiber disassembly and the formation of cortical actin. To assess the mechanism(s) by which TSC2 loss promotes actin re-arrangement and cell migration, we explored the role of known downstream effectors of TSC2, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Increased migration of Tsc2(-/-) MEFs is inhibited by siRNA mTOR and siRNA Rictor, but not siRNA Raptor. siRNA mTOR or siRNA Rictor promoted stress fiber disassembly in TSC2-null cells, while siRNA Raptor had little effect. Overexpression of kinase-dead mTOR induced actin stress fiber disassembly and suppressed TSC2-deficient cell migration. Our data demonstrate that TSC1 and TSC2 differentially regulate actin stress fiber formation and cell migration, and that only TSC2 loss promotes mTOR- and mTORC2-dependent pro-migratory cell phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Most individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are born with a mutant allele of either TSC1 or TSC2 and a mosaic of psychological and cognitive defects. Tsc1 loss of heterozygosity contributes to severe dendritic abnormalities that are rescued by normalizing the levels of the actin-cross linking protein, Filamin A (FLNA). However, it is unclear whether dendrites and FLNA levels are abnormal in an heterozygote Tsc1 condition. Here, we examined dendritic morphology and FLNA levels in the olfactory bulb of Tsc1 wild type and heterozygote mice. Using in vivo neonatal electroporation to label newborn neurons followed by sholl analysis, we found that Tsc1 haploinsufficiency is associated with increased dendritic complexity and total dendritic length as well as increased FLNA levels. Since reducing FLNA levels has been shown to decrease Tsc1(+/-) dendritic complexity, these data suggest that increased FLNA levels in Tsc1(+/-) mice contribute to abnormal dendritic patterning in the Tsc1 heterozygote condition of individuals with TSC.",

    "issue": "10()",
    "pages": "596609",
    "abstract": "Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) is an estuarine bacterium that is capable of causing rapidly fatal infection in humans. Proper polarization and bactericidal activity of macrophages play essential roles in defending against invading pathogens. How macrophages limit V. vulnificus infection remains not well understood. Here we report that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is crucial for the regulation of V. vulnificus-induced macrophage polarization, bacterial clearance, and cell death. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of TSC1 exhibit a significant reduction of survival time after V. vulnificus infection. V. vulnificus infection induces both M1 and M2 polarization. However, TSC1 deficient macrophages show enhanced M1 response to V. vulnificus infection. Interestedly, the absence of TSC1 in myeloid cells results in impaired bacterial clearance both in vivo and in vitro after V. vulnificus infection. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity significantly reverses V. vulnificus-induced hypersensitive M1 response and resistant bactericidal activity both in wild-type and TSC1-deficient macrophages. Moreover, V. vulnificus infection causes cell death of macrophages, possibly contributes to defective of bacterial clearance, which also exhibits in a mTORC1-dependent manner. These findings highlight an essential role for the TSC1-mTOR signaling in the regulation of innate immunity against V. vulnificus infection.",

    "abstract": "The bone size and quality, acquired during adolescent growth under the influence of anabolic hormones, growth factors, and nutrients, determine the height and bone stability and forecast osteoporosis risks in late life. Yet bone size and quality control mechanisms remain enigmatic. To study the roles of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, sensor of growth factors and nutrients, in bone size and quality regulation, we ablated Tsc1, a suppressor of mTOR, in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), monocytes, or their progenies osteoblasts and osteoclasts. mTOR activation in MSCs, but much less in osteoblasts, increased bone width and mass due to MSC hyperproliferation, but decreased bone length and mineral contents due to defective MSC differentiation. mTOR activation promotes bone mineral accretion by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activity directly or via coupling with MSCs. Tuberous sclerosis complex patient studies confirmed these findings. Thus, mTOR regulates bone size via MSCs and bone quality by suppressing catabolic activities of osteoclasts.",

    "abstract": "Kidney fibroblasts play a crucial role in dictating tubular cell fate and the outcome of acute kidney injury (AKI). The underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Here, we found that mTOR signaling was activated in fibroblasts from mouse kidneys with ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Ablation of fibroblast Rheb or Rictor promoted, while ablation of fibroblast Tsc1 protected against tubular cell death and IRI in mice. In tubular cells cultured with conditioned media (CM) from Rheb-/- or Rictor-/- fibroblasts, less hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-met signaling activation or staurosporine-induced cell apoptosis was observed. While CM from Tsc1-/- fibroblasts promoted tubular cell c-met signaling activation and inhibited staurosporine-induced cell apoptosis. In kidney fibroblasts, blocking mTOR signaling downregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and HGF. Downregulating fibroblast HGF expression or blocking tubular cell c-met signaling facilitated tubular cell apoptosis. Notably, renal PPARγ and HGF expression was less in mice with fibroblast Rheb or Rictor ablation, but more in mice with fibroblast Tsc1 ablation than their littermate controls, respectively. Together, these data suggest that mTOR signaling activation in kidney fibroblasts protects against tubular cell death and dictates the outcome of AKI through stimulating PPARγ and HGF expression.",

    "issue": "35(1)",
    "pages": "153-66",
    "abstract": "Plasma cells (PCs) are responsible for the secretion of antibodies. The development of fully functional PCs relies on the activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 (IRE1/XBP-1) arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP-1-deficient PCs secrete antibodies poorly and exhibit distensions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) promotes anabolic activities and is negatively regulated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Deletion of TSC1 renders mTOR hyperactive. To explore the relationship between mTOR and the UPR in PC development and function, mice with conditional deletions of XBP-1 and/or TSC1 in their B cell lineage were generated. Deletion of TSC1 enhanced Ig synthesis and promoted differentiation into PCs independently of XBP-1, as evidenced by comparison of TSC1/XBP-1 double-knockout (DKO) PCs to XBP-1 knockout (KO) PCs. The typical morphological abnormalities of the ER in XBP-1 KO PCs were alleviated in the DKO PCs. Expression profiling identified the glycoprotein Ly6C as an mTOR target. Ly6C expression contributed to the enhanced Ig secretion from DKO PCs. Our data reveal a functional overlap between mTOR and the UPR in promoting PC development. In addition to the classical mTOR role in promoting protein synthesis, the mechanism entails transcription regulation of accessory molecules, such as Ly6C.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by the mutation of one of the two tumor suppressor genes: TSC1 or TSC2, encoding protein products, hamartin, and tuberin, respectively. Both proteins form intracellular complexes exerting inhibitory activity on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. It has been demonstrated that signal transduction from tuberin to mTOR is mediated by a G protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). In normal cells, tuberin having GTPase-activating protein properties toward Rheb controls signals of nutrient depletion, hypoxia, or stress, not allowing activation of mTOR and subsequent protein translation and cell proliferation. However, when environmental conditions change, tuberin is phosphorylated and it forms a complex with hamartin is degraded, and downstream targets of mTOR, S6K, and eEF2K, can be activated. In this review, we summarize very recent information contributing to our knowledge of TSC2 regulation by four cellular signaling pathways: PI3K/Akt, Ras/MAPK, LKB1/AMPK, and REDD1.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous syndrome that can affect the brain, skin, eyes, kidneys, heart, and lungs. TSC alters cellular proliferation and differentiation, resulting in hamartomas of various organs, tumor formation, and altered neuronal migration. The phenotype is highly variable. Most individuals have seizures, commonly including infantile spasms, and there is variable intellectual disability and autism. Neonates can present with cardiac failure due to intracardiac rhabdomyomas. The likelihood of renal angiomyolipomas increases with age, and renal disease is the most common cause of death in adults with TSC. Pulmonary involvement occurs predominantly in women and carries a high morbidity and mortality. TSC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but spontaneous mutations are common. A mutation of either TSC1 on chromosome 9 or TSC2 on chromosome 16 leads to dysfunction of hamartin or tuberin, respectively. These two proteins form a functional complex that modulates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Medications that inhibit mTOR are being used to treat TSC-related tumors, and current studies are investigating whether these agents could alleviate other TSC complications. Consensus statements guide identification and optimal management of many of the TSC-related complications at diagnosis and throughout the lifespan. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for optimal management of individuals with TSC.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 and is characterized by uncontrolled mTORC1 activation. Drugs that reduce mTOR activity are only partially successful in the treatment of TSC, suggesting that mTOR-independent pathways play a role in disease development. Here, kinome profiles of wild-type and Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated, revealing a prominent role for PAK2 in signal transduction downstream of TSC1/2. Further investigation showed that the effect of the TSC1/2 complex on PAK2 is mediated through RHEB, but is independent of mTOR and p21RAC. We also demonstrated that PAK2 over-activation is likely responsible for the migratory and cell cycle abnormalities observed in Tsc2(-/-) MEFs. Finally, we detected high levels of PAK2 activation in giant cells in the brains of TSC patients. These results show that PAK2 is a direct effector of TSC1-TSC2-RHEB signaling and a new target for rational drug therapy in TSC.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a crucial role in the control of T cell fate determination; however, the precise regulatory mechanism of the mTOR pathway is not fully understood. We found that T cell-specific deletion of the gene encoding tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), an upstream negative regulator of mTOR, resulted in augmented Th1 and Th17 differentiation and led to severe intestinal inflammation in a colitis model. Conditional Tsc1 deletion in Tregs impaired their suppressive activity and expression of the Treg marker Foxp3 and resulted in increased IL-17 production under inflammatory conditions. A fate-mapping study revealed that Tsc1-null Tregs that lost Foxp3 expression gained a stronger effector-like phenotype compared with Tsc1-/- Foxp3+ Tregs. Elevated IL-17 production in Tsc1-/- Treg cells was reversed by in vivo knockdown of the mTOR target S6K1. Moreover, IL-17 production was enhanced by Treg-specific double deletion of Tsc1 and Foxo3a. Collectively, these studies suggest that TSC1 acts as an important checkpoint for maintaining immune homeostasis by regulating cell fate determination.",

    "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that has been found to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. However, how RSV exerts its beneficial health effects remains largely unknown. Here, we show that RSV inhibits insulin- and leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in C2C12 fibroblasts via a Sirt1-independent mechanism. Treating C2C12 cells with RSV dramatically inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt, S6 kinase, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but had little effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and activation of the p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway. RSV treatment also partially blocked mTOR and S6 kinase phosphorylation in TSC1/2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of an inhibitory site downstream of TSC1/2. Knocking out PDK1 or suppressing AMP-activated protein kinase had little effect on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling. On the other hand, RSV significantly increased the association between mTOR and its inhibitor, DEPTOR. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling was greatly reduced in cells in which the expression levels of DEPTOR were suppressed by RNAi. Taken together, our studies reveal that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR interaction and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively regulates mTOR activity.",

    "abstract": "Uterine perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare neoplasms. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway upregulation is critical for their pathogenesis and is often associated with TSC1/TSC2 inactivation. Although first line mTOR inhibitors are an effective treatment, metastatic PEComas eventually progress. A 53-year-old woman presented a 4-month history of post-menopausal vaginal bleeding. Clinical and radiological examination detected a uterine mass and a single S1 bone lesion. The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy and bone biopsy. The anatomopathological evaluation concluded to an oligo-metastatic uterine PEComa. The tumor harbored a heterozygous deletion of 9q34 that contains the TSC1 gene. Concerning the primary lesion, the resection was complete and the single bone metastasis was treated with radiotherapy. Three months later, the patient presented bone, lung and subcutaneous metastatic progression. An everolimus and denosumab treatment was initiated. After 2 years of treatment, a clinically significant bone, lung and subcutaneous progression was detected. Following a literature review of the possible therapeutic options, we initiated a second line treatment by pazopanib. This treatment resulted in regression of the subcutaneous lesions and stability of lung and bone metastases. In this challenging, rare setting, our report suggests single agent, anti-angiogenic, tyrosine kinase inhibitor to be effective as second line treatment of metastatic uterine PEComa progressing on mTOR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and is associated with hamartoma formation in multiple organ systems. The neurological manifestations of TSC are particularly challenging and include infantile spasms, intractable epilepsy, cognitive disabilities, and autism. Progress over the past 15 years has demonstrated that the TSC1 or TSC2 encoded proteins modulate cell function via the mTOR signaling cascade and serve as keystones in regulating cell growth and proliferation. The mTOR pathway provides an intersection for an intricate network of protein cascades that respond to cellular nutrition, energy levels, and growth-factor stimulation. In the brain, TSC1 and TSC2 have been implicated in cell body size, dendritic arborization, axonal outgrowth and targeting, neuronal migration, cortical lamination, and spine formation. Antagonism of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin and related compounds may provide new therapeutic options for TSC patients.",

    "pages": "184-189",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTransient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of ion channels termed after the trp gene in Drosophila that are diverse in structure and control a wide range of biological functions including cell development and growth, thermal regulation, and vascular physiology. Of significant interest is the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) receptor, also known as the capsaicin receptor and the vanilloid receptor 1, that is a non-selective cation channel sensitive to a host of external stimuli including capsaicin and camphor, venoms, acid/basic pH changes, and temperature.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGiven the multiple modalities that TRPV1 receptors impact in the body, we examined and discussed the role of these receptors in vasomotor control, metabolic disorders, cellular injury, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and neurodegenerative disorders and their overlap with other signal transduction pathways that impact trophic factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSurprisingly, TRPV1 receptors do not rely entirely upon calcium signaling to affect cellular biology, but also have a close relationship with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (Akt) that have roles in pain sensitivity, stem cell development, cellular survival, and cellular metabolism. These pathways with TRPV1 converge in the signaling of growth factors with recent work highlighting a relationship with erythropoietin (EPO). Angiogenesis and endothelial tube formation controlled by EPO requires, in part, the activation of TRPV1 receptors in conjunction with Akt and AMPK pathways.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTRPV1 receptors could prove to become vital to target disorders of vascular origin and neurodegeneration. Broader and currently unrealized implementations for both EPO and TRPV1 receptors can be envisioned for for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in multiple systems of the body.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the role and regulatory mechanisms of Akt/TSC1-TSC2/mTOR signal pathway on the hepatocyte growth and proliferation after partial hepatectomy in rats.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used the animal model of 70% hepatectomy, separated and cultivated hepatocytes. According to the different time points after partial hepatectomy, it could be grouped into 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h and 72 h. According to the different kinds of specific inhibitor in the nutritive medium after the separation of hepatocytes, it could be grouped into Triciribine (TR), Rapamycin (RA) and Control (CO). We investigated (3)H-Leucine incorporation into protein, the cross section areas of hepatocytes, and detected cell cycle through FCM. The expressions of phosphorylated protein TSC2 and mTOR were observed.\n\n\nRESULTS\n(1) The content of phosphorylated protein TSC2 in group CO began to increase at 2 h and got to the peak at 6 h but declined at 24 h. The content of phosphorylated protein TSC2 in group RA had the same variation with that of phosphorylated protein TSC2 in group CO. (2) At the time point of 0 h, 2 h, 6 h and 24 h after operation, the incorporation efficiency of (3)H-Leucine in groups RA and TR was different from that in group CO in statistics (P<0.01). (3) It could be seen that the cross section areas of hepatocytes in groups RA and TR were different from that in group CO in statistics at 2 h and 6 h after operation (P<0.05). (4) Comparing with the other two inhibitor groups (TR and RA), the number of cells during the period of G0/G1 in group CO became fewer, while the number of cells during the period of S and G2/M grew obviously (referring to Fig. 8). After operation, each time point was different from the inhibitor groups obviously (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The peak declined greatly at 24 h and 72 h after operation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data strongly suggest the effects of Akt/TSC1-TSC2/mTOR signal pathway on hepatocyte growth, protein synthesis and cell cycle, and prove its contribution to liver regeneration.",

    "issue": "76(3)",
    "pages": "639-651",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nEither activation of mTORC1 due to loss of Tsc1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1) or defective hepatic autophagy due to loss of Atg5 leads to spontaneous liver tumorigenesis in mice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which autophagy contributes to the hepatic metabolic changes and tumorigenesis mediated by mTORC1 activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAtg5 Flox/Flox (Atg5F/F) and Tsc1F/F mice were crossed with albumin-Cre mice to generate liver-specific Atg5 knockout (L-Atg5 KO), L-Tsc1 KO and L-Atg5/Tsc1 double KO (DKO) mice. These mice were crossed with p62/Sqstm1F/F (p62) and whole body Nrf2 KO mice to generate L-Atg5/Tsc1/p62 and L-Atg5/Tsc1-Nrf2 triple KO mice. These mice were housed for various periods up to 12 months, and blood and liver tissues were harvested for biochemical and histological analysis RESULTS: Deletion of Atg5 in L-Tsc1 KO mice inhibited liver tumorigenesis but increased mortality and was accompanied by drastically enhanced hepatic ductular reaction (DR), hepatocyte degeneration and metabolic reprogramming. Deletion of p62 reversed DR, hepatocyte degeneration and metabolic reprogramming as well as the mortality of L-Atg5/Tsc1 DKO mice, but unexpectedly promoted liver tumorigenesis via activation of a group of oncogenic signaling pathways. Nrf2 ablation markedly improved DR with increased hepatocyte population and improved metabolic reprogramming and survival of the L-Atg5/Tsc1 DKO mice without tumor formation. Decreased p62 and increased mTOR activity were also observed in a subset of human hepatocellular carcinomas.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results reveal previously undescribed functions of hepatic p62 in suppressing tumorigenesis and regulating liver cell repopulation and metabolic reprogramming resulting from persistent mTORC1 activation and defective autophagy.\n\n\nLAY SUMMARY\nMetabolic liver disease and viral hepatitis are common chronic liver diseases and risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma, which are often associated with impaired hepatic autophagy and increased mTOR activation. Using multiple genetically engineered mouse models of defective hepatic autophagy and persistent mTOR activation, we dissected the complex mechanisms behind this observation. Our results uncovered an unexpected novel tumor suppressor function of p62/Sqstm1, which regulated liver cell repopulation, ductular reaction and metabolic reprogramming in liver tumorigenesis.",

    "issue": "236(12)",
    "pages": "8110-8121",
    "abstract": "Even though aberrant mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is known to cause cardiomyopathy, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Because augmentation of αB-crystallin and hspB2 was presented in the cortical tubers and lymphangioleiomyomatosis of tuberous sclerosis complex patients, we deciphered the role of αB-crystallin and its adjacent duplicate gene, hspB2, in hyperactive mTOR-induced cardiomyopathy. Cardiac Tsc1 deletion (T1-hKO) caused mouse mTOR activation and cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of αB-crystallin and hspB2 was presented in the hearts of these mice. Knockout of αB-crystallin/hspB2 reversed deficient Tsc1-mediated fetal gene expression, mTOR activation, mitochondrial damage, cardiomyocyte vacuolar degeneration, cardiomyocyte size, and fibrosis of T1-hKO mice. These cardiac-Tsc1; αB-crystallin; hspB2 triple knockout (tKO) mice had improved cardiac function, smaller heart weight to body weight ratio, and reduced lethality compared with T1-hKO mice. Even though activated mTOR suppressed autophagy in T1-hKO mice, ablation of αB-crystallin and hspB2 failed to restore autophagy in tKO mice. mTOR inhibitors suppressed αB-crystallin expression in T1-hKO mice and rat cardiomyocyte line H9C2. Starvation of H9C2 cells activated autophagy and suppressed αB-crystallin expression. Since inhibition of autophagy restored αB-crystallin expression in starved H9C2 cells, autophagy is a negative regulator of αB-crystallin expression. mTOR thus stimulates αB-crystallin expression through suppression of autophagy. In conclusion, αB-crystallin and hspB2 play a pivotal role in Tsc1 knockout-related cardiomyopathy and are therapeutic targets of hyperactive mTOR-associated cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 is often mutated in bladder cancer. However the importance of this event in disease pathogenesis and its implications for therapy are uncertain. We used genomic sequencing to examine the involvement of TSC1 in bladder cancer, and signalling pathway analysis and small-molecule screening to identify targeted therapeutic strategies in TSC1 mutant bladder cancer cell lines. TSC1 loss of heterozygosity was seen in 54% of bladder cancers. Two (4.9%) of these 41 bladder cancers had TSC1 mutations by exon-based sequencing. Analysis of 27 bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated inactivating TSC1 mutations in three: RT-4, HCV29, 97-1. Interestingly, only RT-4 showed classic feedback inhibition of AKT, and was highly sensitive to treatment with mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin1. 97-1 cells showed constitutive EGFR activation, and were highly sensitive to combined treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 and EGFR inhibitors Lapatinib or Afatinib. A BRAF missense mutation G469V was found in HCV29 cells, and AKT activation was dependent on BRAF, but independent of ERK. A kinase inhibitor screen of HCV29 cells showed strong growth inhibition by the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, and we then found synergistic inhibitory effects of NVP-AUY922 combined with either Torin1 or rapamycin on cell survival for both HCV29 and 97-1 cells. In aggregate, these findings indicate that there are highly variable mutation profiles and signalling pathway activation in TSC1-mutant bladder cancer. Furthermore, combined Hsp90/mTOR inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for TSC1 mutant bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) undergo proliferation by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway under hypoxia. Hypoxia induces expression of a specific set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of cell types. We integrated genomic analyses of both small non-coding RNA and coding transcripts using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based RNA sequencing with the molecular mechanism of the mTOR signaling pathway in hypoxic PASMCs. These analyses revealed hypoxia-induced miR-92b-3p as a potent regulator of the mTOR signaling pathway. We demonstrated that miR-92b-3p directly targets the 3'-UTR of a negative regulator in the mTOR signaling pathway, TSC1. mTOR signaling and consequent cell proliferation were promoted by enforced expression of miR-92b-3p but inhibited by knocking down endogenous miR-92b-3p. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-92b-3p attenuated hypoxia-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Therefore, this study elucidates a novel role of miR-92b-3p as a hypoxamir in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway and the pathological VSMC proliferative response under hypoxia. These findings will help us better understand the miRNA-mediated molecular mechanism of the proliferative response of hypoxic VSMCs through the mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2-mammalian target of rapamycin (TSC1/2-mTOR) proteins act as integrators of a range of intracellular signalling pathways. Various genetic disorders associated with learning and behavioural deficits, including TSC, Fragile X, Neurofibromatosis Type 1, Noonan and Leopard syndromes, are associated with abnormalities in TSC-mTOR signalling. Based on the assumption that signalling proteins and their structural and functional components are widely conserved, a number of animal models are used to study aspects of the physical and behavioural phenotypes of these human disorders. Model organisms include rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (Mus musculus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Here we used a bioinformatic approach to examine the presence of structural and functional elements of TSC1 and TSC2 across these organisms, together with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Dictyostelium discoideum. Results suggest that while Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus TSC1 and TSC2 showed very high similarity to the human sequences, this was not the case for Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe or Disctyostelium discoideum. Findings indicate that caution should be exercised in detailed interpretation of results from some model organisms.",

The mammalian Tsc1-Tsc2 GTPase activating protein (GAP) heterodimer is a critical negative regulator of Rheb and mTOR activation. The RalGAPα-RalGAPβ heterodimer shares sequence and structural similarity with Tsc1-Tsc2. Unexpectedly, we observed that C. elegans expresses orthologs for the Rheb and RalA/B GTPases and for RalGAPα/β, but not Tsc1/2. This prompted our investigation to determine whether RalGAPs additionally modulate mTOR signaling. We determined that C. elegans RalGAP loss decreased lifespan, consistent with a Tsc-like function. Additionally, RalGAP suppression in mammalian cells caused RalB-selective activation and Sec5- and exocyst-dependent engagement of mTORC1 and suppression of autophagy. Unexpectedly, we also found that Tsc1-Tsc2 loss activated RalA/B independently of Rheb-mTOR signaling. Finally, RalGAP suppression caused mTORC1-dependent pancreatic tumor cell invasion. Our findings identify an unexpected crosstalk and integration of the Ral and mTOR signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by benign tumor formation in multiple organs. Hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the primary alteration underlying TSC tumor. Thus, rapamycin, as an mTOR specific inhibitor, has been assumed as a potential drug for the treatment of TSC. However, its application in TSC patients has been limited due to side effects. By analyzing Tsc1- or Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we found that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 led to a decreased sensitivity to MK-2206, a novel allosteric Akt inhibitor. Ectopic expression of a constitutively activated Akt (myristoylated Akt-1, myrAkt-1) sensitized Tsc2-null and Tsc1-null MEFs to MK-2206. Furthermore, MK-2206 increased the cytotoxicity of rapamycin in Tsc1 or Tsc2 MEFs. Moreover, the benefit of the combinatorial treatment was also demonstrated in a TSC xenograft mouse model. We conclude that the combination of rapamycin and MK-2206 may be utilized as a new therapeutic regimen for TSC.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a localized cortical malformation and considerable morphological overlap exists between FCD IIB and neurological lesions associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Abnormal mTOR pathway secondary to somatic mTOR mutation and TSC gene mutation linked to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have supported the hypothesis of common pathogenesis involved. Role of converging pathway, viz. Wnt/β-Catenin and mTOR is unknown in FCD. We aimed to analyse FCD IIB for TSC1/TSC2 mutations, immunoreactivity of hamartin, tuberin, mTOR and Wnt signalling cascades, and stem cell markers.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSixteen FCD IIB cases were retrieved along with 16 FCD IIA cases for comparison. Immunohistochemistry was performed for tuberin, hamartin, mTOR pathway markers, markers of stem cell phenotype, and Wnt pathway markers. Mutation analysis for TSC1 and TSC2 was performed by sequencing in 9 FCD cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll FCD cases showed preserved hamartin and tuberin immunoreactivity. Aberrant immunoreactivity of phospho-P70S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal, phospho-S6 ribosomal and Stat3 was noted in FCD IIB, with variable phospho-4E-BP1 (45%) and absent phospho-Stat3 expression. Immunoreactivity for phospho-P70S6 kinase (100%), S6 ribosomal protein (100%) and Stat3 (100%) was noted in FCD IIA, but not for phospho-S6 ribosomal, phospho-4E-BP1 and phospho-Stat3. c-Myc immunoreactivity was noted in all FCD cases. Nestin (81%) and Sox 2 (88%) stained balloon cells in FCD IIB (44%), while in FCD IIA cases were negative. All FCD cases were immunopositive for Wnt, but were negative for β-Catenin and cyclin-D1. TSC mutations were detected in two cases of FCD IIB.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAbnormal mTOR pathway activation exists in FCD IIB and IIA, however, shows differential immunoreactivity profile, indicating varying degrees of dysregulation. Labelling of neuronal stem cell markers in balloon cells suggests they are phenotypically immature. TSC1/2 mutation play role in the pathogenesis of FCD. Deep targeted sequencing is preferred diagnostic technique since conventional sanger sequencing often fails to detect low-allele frequency variants involved in mTOR/TSC pathway genes, commonly found in FCD.",

    "issue": "118()",
    "pages": "109219",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOur previous study found that 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) can repress the expression and activity of protein serine/threonine phosphatase-1γ (PP1γ) in mouse hippocampus. It is well known that PP1γ regulates cell metabolism, which is related to hypoxia/ischaemia tolerance. It has been reported that it can also induce autophagy in cancer cells. Autophagy is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis associated with metabolism. In this study, we examined whether 5-Aza-CdR increases hypoxia tolerance-dependent autophagy by initiating the TSC1/mTOR/autophagy signalling pathway in neuronal cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\n5-Aza-CdR was either administered to mice via intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v) or added to cultured hippocampal-derived neuronal cell line (HT22 cell) in the medium for cell culture. The hypoxia tolerance of mice was measured by hypoxia tolerance time and Perl's iron stain. The mRNA and protein expression levels of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3) were measured by real-time PCR and western blot. The p-mTOR and p-p70S6k proteins were used as markers for mTOR activity. In addition, the role of autophagy was determined by correlating its intensity with hypoxia tolerance in a time-dependent manner. At the same time, the involvement of the TSC1/mTOR pathway in autophagy was also examined through transfection with TSC1 (hamartin) plasmid.\n\n\nRESULTS\n5-Aza-CdR was revealed to increase hypoxia tolerance and induce autophagy, accompanied by an increase in mRNA and protein expression levels of TSC1, reduction in p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p-p70S6k (Thr389) protein levels, and an increase in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in both mouse hippocampus and hippocampal-derived neuronal cell line (HT22). The fluorescence intensity of hamartin was enhanced in the hippocampus of mice exposed to 5-Aza-CdR. Moreover, HT22 cells that over-expressed TSC1 showed more autophagy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n5-Aza-CdR can increase hypoxia tolerance by inducing autophagy by initiating the TSC1/mTOR pathway.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which renal manifestations are prominent. There are three major renal lesions in TSC: angiomyolipomas, cysts, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Major recent advances have revolutionized our understanding of TSC-associated RCC, including two series that together include more than 100 TSC-RCC cases, demonstrating a mean age at onset of about 36 years, tumors in children as young as 7, and a striking 2:1 female predominance. These series also provide the first detailed understanding of the pathologic features of these distinctive tumors, which include chromophobe-like features and eosinophilia, with some of the tumors unclassified. This pathologic heterogeneity is distinctive and reminiscent of the pathologic heterogeneity in Birt-Hogg-Dube-associated RCC, which also includes chromophobe-like tumors. Additional advances include the identification of sporadic counterpart tumors that carry somatic TSC1/TSC2/mTOR mutations. These include unclassified eosinophilic tumors, eosinophilic solid cystic RCC (ESC-RCC), and RCC with leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLMS). A variety of epithelial renal neoplasms have been identified both in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and in the nonsyndromic setting associated with somatic mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. Interestingly, whether tumors are related to a germline or somatic TSC1/2 mutation, these tumors often display similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features. Finally, recent work has identified molecular links between TSC and BHD-associated tumors, involving the TFEB/TFE3 transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal to the induction of adaptive T-cell immune responses. Recent evidence highlights a critical role of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1), a primarily upstream negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in DC development, but whether and how Tsc1 directly regulate mature DC function in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that selective disruption of Tsc1 in DCs results in a lymphoproliferative disorder with the spontaneous activation of T cells. Tsc1 deficiency results in the activation of mTORC1-PPARγ pathway, which leads to the upregulation of neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) expression on DCs to stimulate naive T-cell proliferation. However, Tsc1-deficient DCs have defects in the ability to induce antigen-specific T-cell responses in vitro and in vivo owing to impaired survival during antigen transportation and presentation. Indeed, Tsc1 promotes DC survival through restraining independent mTORC1 and ROS-Bim pathways. Our study identifies Tsc1 as a crucial signaling checkpoint in DCs essential for preserving T-cell homeostasis and response.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a congenital disorder caused by a defective suppressor of the mTOR system, the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Almost all brain symptoms of TSC are manifestations of an excessive activity of the mTOR system. Many children with TSC are afflicted by intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability, and/or autism. In the brains of infants with TSC, a vicious cycle of epileptic encephalopathy is formed by mTOR hyperactivity, abnormal synaptic structure/function, and excessive epileptic discharges, further worsening epilepsy and intellectual/behavioral disorders. Molecular target therapy with mTOR inhibitors has recently been proved to be efficacious for epilepsy in human TSC patients, and for autism in TSC model mice, indicating the possibility for pharmacological treatment of developmental synaptic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Epithelioid glioblastoma is a recognized glioblastoma variant, recently added to the World Health Organization brain tumor classification, with similar prognosis as the classic variant and B-Raf V600E mutations in 50% of the cases. We identified a new subset of epithelioid glioblastoma with periventricular location and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)-like morphology. Genomic profiling of these tumors revealed driver mutations in NF1, subclonal mutations in TSC1, and a novel driver mutation in MTOR, suggesting upregulation of the MAPK/TSC1/mTOR pathway. Strong mTOR activation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the mTOR kinase target 4E-BP1. TSC1 and MTOR mutations have been previously described in low-grade glioma, such as SEGA, and focal cortical dysplasia, respectively, that display large cells with abundant cytoplasm, most likely resulting from the biogenetic signaling of mTOR. Unlike these, the mutations in SEGA-like glioblastoma occurred in the context of other genetic aberrations present in high-grade neoplasms, including in the CDKN2A/B, PIK3R1, PIK3CA and EGFR genes. For one patient with two temporally distinct specimens, the subclonal TSC1 pathogenic mutation was detected only in the specimen showing SEGA-like morphology, indicating requirement for mTOR activation as trigger for specific epithelioid/SEGA-like morphology. As FDA-approved kinase inhibitors are available and target many steps of the MAPK/mTOR pathway, recognition of this new subset of periventricular high-grade gliomas with clear phenotypic-genotypic correlates is essential for prompt biomarker testing and appropriate targeted therapeutic management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the genes TSC1 or TSC2 cause the autosomal dominantly inherited tumor suppressor syndrome tuberous sclerosis, which is characterized by the development of tumors, named hamartomas, in different organs. The TSC gene products, hamartin and tuberin, form a complex, of which tuberin is assumed to be the functional component. Both, hamartin and tuberin have been implicated in the control of the cell cycle by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and in cell size regulation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) a regulator of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and its target the ribosomal protein S6. The tuberin/hamartin complex was shown to protect p27 from protein degradation. Within the mTOR signaling pathway tuberin harbors GTPase activating (GAP) potential toward Rheb, which is a potent regulator of mTOR. In this study, we have analyzed the protein levels of tuberin, p27, cyclin D1, mTOR and phospho mTOR Ser2448 (activated mTOR), S6 and phospho S6 Ser240/244 (activated S6) and as controls alpha-tubulin and topoisomerase IIbeta, in ten different cells, including primary normal cells, immortalized and transformed cell lines.",

TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation lead to dysfunction of hamartin or tuberin, respectively. Hamartin and tuberin form a protein complex that helps regulate cellular proliferation. These proteins form a complex that constitutively inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, leading to permanent activation of mTOR signaling within all TSC-associated lesions. Major features of TSC include tumors of the brain, skin, heart, lungs and kidneys, seizures and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, which can include autism spectrum disorder and cognitive disability. These disorders are usually diagnosed in children and adults. Specific guidelines for diagnosis, surveillance, and management have been proposed by the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group. Several randomized controlled trials led to regulatory approval of the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas, brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, refractory epilepsy and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an inherited neurocutaneous disease, is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. This genetic disorder is characterized by the growth of benign tumors in the brain, kidneys, and other organs. As a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family, nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) plays a vital role in some neuropathological diseases and several types of benign or malignant tumors. Here, we explored the potential regulatory role of TSC1/2 signaling in Nurr1 and the effect of Nurr1 in TSC-related tumors. We found that Nurr1 expression was drastically decreased by the disruption of the TSC1/2 complex in Tsc2-null cells, genetically modified mouse models of TSC, cortical tubers of TSC patients, and kidney tumor tissue obtained from a TSC patient. Deficient TSC1/2 complex downregulated Nurr1 expression in an mTOR-dependent manner. Moreover, hyperactivation of mTOR reduced Nurr1 expression via suppression of autophagy. In addition, Nurr1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed cell cycle progression. Therefore, TSC/mTOR/autophagy/Nurr1 signaling is partially responsible for the tumorigenesis of TSC. Taken together, Nurr1 may be a novel therapeutic target for TSC-associated tumors, and Nurr1 agonists or reagents that induce Nurr1 expression may be used for the treatment of TSC.",

    "title": "Regulation of YAP by mTOR and autophagy reveals a therapeutic target of tuberous sclerosis complex.",
    "issue": "211(11)",
    "pages": "2249-63",
    "abstract": "Genetic studies have shown that the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1-TSC2-mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and the Hippo-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathways are master regulators of organ size, which are often involved in tumorigenesis. The crosstalk between these signal transduction pathways in coordinating environmental cues, such as nutritional status and mechanical constraints, is crucial for tissue growth. Whether and how mTOR regulates YAP remains elusive. Here we describe a novel mouse model of TSC which develops renal mesenchymal lesions recapitulating human perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) from patients with TSC. We identify that YAP is up-regulated by mTOR in mouse and human PEComas. YAP inhibition blunts abnormal proliferation and induces apoptosis of TSC1-TSC2-deficient cells, both in culture and in mosaic Tsc1 mutant mice. We further delineate that YAP accumulation in TSC1/TSC2-deficient cells is due to impaired degradation of the protein by the autophagosome/lysosome system. Thus, the regulation of YAP by mTOR and autophagy is a novel mechanism of growth control, matching YAP activity with nutrient availability under growth-permissive conditions. YAP may serve as a potential therapeutic target for TSC and other diseases with dysregulated mTOR activity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, on invasive malignant renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFrom Oct 2014 to May 2019, we collected data from seven patients with a definite (clinical and pathological) diagnosis of EAML received everolimus in our hospital. Targeted sequence capture array technique with next-generation of high throughput sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect mutations of TSC1/2 genes. All patients had received surgery and everolimus. The clinical efficacy and safety of the therapy were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMutations of TSC1 and TSC2 were detected in two and three patients though targeted sequence capture array technique with NGS, respectively. Among seven patients, three had missense mutations, one had nonsense mutation, and one had the large fragment deletion mutation. Five patients accompanied with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were identified. All patients were administered 10mg everolimus once daily, the treatment duration lasted for 3 to 28 months. The objective response was assessed 3 months later, five partial response, two stable disease (SD), the mean greatest tumor diameter of all patients decreased from 9.6 to 5.2cm. Six patients stayed SD and one patient died during follow up. Patients accompanying with TSC had better responses to everolimus compared with non-TSC.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe mTOR inhibitor can be an effective treatment for patients with invasive malignant renal EAML. Patients with TSC may benefit more from the therapy.",

    "issue": "10(5)",
    "pages": "793-799",
    "abstract": "Atorvastatin is widely used to lower blood cholesterol and to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease-associated complications. Epidemiological investigations and preclinical studies suggest that statins such as atorvastatin have antitumor activity for various types of cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations that lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and tumor formation in multiple organs. Previous studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin selectively suppressed growth and proliferation of mouse Tsc2 null embryonic fibroblasts through inhibition of mTOR. However, atorvastatin alone did not reduce tumor burden in the liver and kidneys of Tsc2+/- mice as assessed by histological analysis, and no combination therapy of rapamycin and atorvastatin has been tried. In this study, we used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to track changes in tumor number and size in the kidneys of a Tsc1+/- mouse model and to assess the efficacy of rapamycin and atorvastatin alone and as a combination therapy. We found that rapamycin alone or rapamycin combined with atorvastatin significantly reduced tumor burden, while atorvastatin alone did not. Combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin appeared to be more effective for treating renal tumors than rapamycin alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin is unlikely to provide additional benefit over rapamycin as a single agent in the treatment of Tsc-associated renal tumors.",

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a potentially devastating disease associated with mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and 2, that function as a complex to suppress signaling in the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP pathway. However, the inhibitory target of TSC1/2 and the mechanism by which it acts are unknown. Here we provide evidence that TSC1/2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb and that insulin-mediated Rheb activation is PI3K dependent. Moreover, Rheb overexpression induces S6K1 phosphorylation and inhibits PKB phosphorylation, as do loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2, but contrary to earlier reports Rheb has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, coexpression of a human TSC2 cDNA harboring a disease-associated point mutation in the GAP domain, failed to stimulate Rheb GTPase activity or block Rheb activation of S6K1.",

    "issue": "11(1)",
    "pages": "7787",
    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is attributed to the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In recent years, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in oral carcinogenesis by acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. TSC1, as a component of the above pathway, regulates several cellular functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Downregulation of TSC1 is reported in oral as well as several other cancers and is associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome in patients. Here we show that oncogenic miR-130a binds to the 3'UTR of TSC1 and represses its expression. MiR-130a-mediated repression of TSC1 increases cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion of OSCC cells, which is dependent on the presence of the 3'UTR in TSC1. We observe an inverse correlation between the expression levels of miR-130a and TSC1 in OSCC samples, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant. Delivery of antagomiR-130a to OSCC cells results in a significant decrease in xenograft size. Taken together, the findings of the study indicate that miR-130a-mediated TSC1 downregulation is not only a novel mechanism in OSCC, but also the restoration of TSC1 levels by antagomiR-130a may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OSCC.",

TSC1 mutations are associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), characterized by multiple benign tumors of mesenchymal and epithelial origin. TSC1 modulates self-renewal and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells; however, its effects on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are unknown. We investigated the impact of Tsc1 inactivation in murine bone marrow (BM)-MSCs, using tissue-specific, transgelin (Tagln)-mediated cre-recombination, targeting both BM-MSCs and smooth muscle cells. Tsc1 mutants were viable, but homozygous inactivation led to a dwarfed appearance with TSC-like pathologies in multiple organs and reduced survival. In young (28 day old) mice, Tsc1 deficiency-induced significant cell expansion of non-hematopoietic BM in vivo, and MSC colony-forming potential in vitro, that was normalized upon treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus. The hyperproliferative BM-MSC phenotype was lost in aged (1.5 yr) mice, and Tsc1 inactivation was also accompanied by elevated ROS and increased senescence. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of Tsc1 in BM-MSCs replicated the hyperproliferative BM-MSC phenotype and led to impaired adipogenic and myogenic differentiation. Our data show that Tsc1 is a negative regulator of BM-MSC proliferation and support a pivotal role for the Tsc1-mTOR axis in the maintenance of the mesenchymal progenitor pool.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAssuming an association between cancer and metabolism, oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming in cancer has revealed new target strategies. For example, the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway genes are already known to alter the cell metabolism and to play a critical role in the malignant behavior of cancer. Accordingly, based on the assumption that genetic variations in the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway can change the intracellular signal in terms of metabolic reprogramming, the present study analyzed 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the STK11, PRKAA1, TSC1/2, and mTOR genes and their impact on the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeven hundred seventy-two patients with surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the present study. Eighteen SNPs were selected from an in silico analysis based on previous evidence of association. The SNP genotyping was performed using a SEQUENOM MassARRAY.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 18 polymorphisms, three SNPs (STK11 rs741765, PRKAA1 rs461404, and TSC1 rs13295634) were significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). In a multivariate analysis, the GG genotype of STK11, TT genotype of PRKAA1, and TG or GG genotype of TSC1 were identified as independent prognostic factors for a worse DFS (hazard ratio = 1.398, 1.408, and 1.388; p = 0.030, 0.013, and 0.002, respectively) and OS (hazard ratio = 1.431, 1.680, and 1.394; p = 0.038, 0.001, and 0.009, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present results suggest that genetic variants of the STK11, PRKAA1, and TSC1 genes could be used as prognostic biomarkers for patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant and multi-system genetic disorder in humans. TSC affects around 25,000 to 40,000 individuals in the United States and about 1 to 2 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 6,000 newborns. TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders. TSC is caused by defects or mutations in two genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Loss of TSC1/TSC2 leads to dysregulation of mTOR, resulting in aberrant cell differentiation and development, and abnormal enlargement of cells. TSC is characterized by the development of benign and/or malignant tumors in several organs including renal/liver angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibroma, lymphangiomyomatosis, cardiac rhabdomyomas, retinal astrocytic, renal cell carcinoma, and brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA). In addition, TSC disease causes disabling neurologic disorders, including epilepsy, mental retardation and autism. Particularly problematic are the development of renal angiomyolipomas, which tend to be larger, bilateral, multifocal and present at a younger age compared with sporadic forms. In addition, SEGA block the flow of fluid within the brain, causing a buildup of fluid and pressure that leads to blurred vision and seizures. In the current review, we describe the pathology of TSC disease in key organs and summarize the use of mTOR inhibitors to treat tumors in TSC patients.",

    "issue": "108(38)",
    "pages": "15996-6001",
    "abstract": "Converging evidence from the analysis of human brain tumors and genetically engineered mice has revealed that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a central regulator of glial and glioma cell growth. In this regard, mutational inactivation of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and PTEN genes is associated with glioma formation, such that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR signaling results in attenuated tumor growth. This shared dependence on mTOR suggests that PTEN and NF1 (neurofibromin) glial growth regulation requires TSC/Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) control of mTOR function. In this report, we use a combination of genetic silencing in vitro and conditional mouse transgenesis approaches in vivo to demonstrate that neurofibromin regulates astrocyte cell growth and glioma formation in a TSC/Rheb-independent fashion. First, we show that Nf1 or Pten inactivation, but not Tsc1 loss or Rheb overexpression, increases astrocyte cell growth in vitro. Second, Nf1-deficient increased mTOR signaling and astrocyte hyperproliferation is unaffected by Rheb shRNA silencing. Third, conditional Tsc1 inactivation or Rheb overexpression in glial progenitors of Nf1(+/-) mice does not lead to glioma formation. Collectively, these findings establish TSC/Rheb-independent mechanisms for mTOR-dependent glial cell growth control and gliomagenesis relevant to the design of therapies for individuals with glioma.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. It associates with multiple proteins and forms two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Accumulating evidence has revealed critical roles for intact mTOR signaling during T-cell activation and responses to microbial infection. However, the importance of mTOR regulation in T cells has yet to be explored. The TSC1/TSC2 complex has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 signaling in cell line models. We show here that deletion of TSC1 in the murine T-cell lineage results in a dramatic reduction of the peripheral T-cell pool, correlating with increased cell death. While mTORC1 is constitutively activated, mTORC2 signaling, reflected by Akt phosphorylation and activity, is decreased in TSC1-deficient T cells. Furthermore, TSC1-deficient T cells contain elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibit decreased mitochondrial content and membrane potential, which is correlated with the activation of the intrinsic death pathway. Overall, our results demonstrate that TSC1 differentially regulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity, promotes T-cell survival, and is critical for normal mitochondrial homeostasis in T cells.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (also known as tuberous sclerosis complex [TSC]) is a multisystem genetic disorder that affects almost every organ in the body. Mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes lead to disruption of the TSC1-TSC2 intracellular protein complex, causing overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein complex. The surveillance and management guidelines and clinical criteria for tuberous sclerosis were revised in 2012, and mTOR inhibitors are now recommended as treatment options for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas-two common features of the disease. However, most morbidity and mortality caused by tuberous sclerosis is associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Treatment of epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis remains a major challenge, with more than 60% of patients having ongoing seizures. Tuberous-sclerosis-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) are multilevel and occur in most individuals with the disorder, but are rarely assessed and treated. Clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors to treat seizures and TAND are underway. Management of the neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disorder should be coordinated with treatment of other organ systems. In view of the age-related expression of manifestations from infancy to adulthood, continuity of clinical care and ongoing monitoring is paramount, and particular attention is needed to plan transition of patient care from childhood to adult services.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant benign tumour syndrome caused by mutations to either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, form a protein complex that integrates inputs from multiple signalling cascades to inactivate the small GTPase rheb, and thereby inhibit mTOR-dependent cell growth. We have used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight and Fourier transform mass spectrometry to identify TSC1 and TSC2 phosphorylation sites and candidate TSC1 and TSC2 interacting proteins. We identified three sites of TSC2 phosphorylation and a novel site of TSC1 phosphorylation, and investigated the roles of these sites in regulating the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. In addition, we identified three TSC1-TSC2 interacting proteins, including DOCK7 a putative rhebGEF.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor entity with an unfavorable prognosis. Recent whole-exome sequencing identified p53 mutations in a subset of human ACC. Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is associated with various pancreatic neoplasms. We thus aimed at analyzing whether activation of mTOR with a concomitant loss of p53 may initiate ACC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe generated transgenic mouse models in which mTOR was hyperactivated through pancreas-specific, homozygous tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) deficiency, with or without deletion of p53 (Tsc1 (-/-) and Tsc1 (-/-) ; p53 (-/-) ). Activity of mTOR signaling was investigated using mouse tissues and isolated murine cell lines. Human ACC specimens were used to corroborate the findings from the transgenic mouse models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHyperactive mTOR signaling in Tsc1 (-/-) mice was not oncogenic but rather induced a near-complete loss of the pancreatic acinar compartment. Acinar cells were lost as a result of apoptosis which was associated with p53 activation. Concomitantly, ductal cells were enriched. Ablation of p53 in Tsc1-deficient mice prevented acinar cell death but promoted formation of acinar cells with severe nuclear abnormalities. One out of seven Tsc1 (-/-) ; p53 (-/-) animals developed pancreatic tumors showing a distinctive tumor morphology, reminiscent of human ACC. Hyperactive mTOR signaling was also detected in a subset of human ACC.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHyperactive mTOR signaling combined with loss of p53 in mice induces tumors similar to human ACC.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disorder that results from heterozygous mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. The primary organ systems that are affected include the brain, skin, lung, kidney, and heart, all with variable frequency, penetrance, and severity. Neurological features include epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability. There are more than 1,500 known pathogenic variants for TSC1 and TSC2, including deletion, nonsense, and missense mutations, and all pathogenic mutations are inactivating, leading to loss of function effects on the encoded proteins TSC1 and TSC2. These proteins form a complex to constitutively inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and as a consequence, mTOR signaling is constitutively active within all TSC-associated lesions. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus have been shown to reduce the size of renal and brain lesions and improve pulmonary function in TSC, and these compounds may also decrease seizure frequency. The clinical application of mTOR inhibitors in TSC has provided one of the first examples of precision medicine in a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

Recent studies highlight the importance of both traditional and newly recognized interactors of mTOR, such as p70S6K, 4EBP1, GSK-3β, REDD1/RTP801, TSC1/TSC2, growth factors, wingless, and forkhead transcription factors, that influence Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, tuberous sclerosis, and epilepsy.

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare systemic neoplastic disease that exclusively happens in women. Studies focusing on LAM and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have made great progress in understanding the pathogenesis and searching for treatment. The inactive mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 is found in patients with LAM to activate the crucial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and result in enhanced cell proliferation and migration. However, it does not explain every step of tumorigenesis in LAM. Because cessation of rapamycin would break the stabilization of lung function or improved quality of life and lead to disease recurrent, continued studies on the pathogenesis of LAM are necessary to identify novel targets and new treatment. Researchers have found several aberrant regulations that affect the mTOR pathway such as its upstream or downstream molecules and compensatory pathways in LAM. Some therapeutic targets have been under study in clinical trials. New methods like genome-wide association studies have located a novel gene related to LAM. Herein, we review the current knowledge regarding pathogenesis and treatment of LAM and summarize novel targets of therapeutic potential recently.",

We tested this hypothesis in patients from a randomized phase II trial of everolimus versus sunitinib.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nArchival specimens collected at baseline were analyzed with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Focus of interest were alterations in key PI3K pathway components. PTEN expression was assessed by IHC. Association between molecular findings and treatment outcomes was investigated; same associations were tested for 2 everolimus-treated trial cohorts in gastric and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 184 everolimus-treated patients with RCC with NGS data, mutation rates in genes of interest were 6% (TSC1), 4.4% (TSC2), and 8.2% (mTOR); 44% harbored alterations in ≥1 PI3K pathway component. For subjects with presence versus absence of mutations in TSC1, TSC2, or mTOR progression-free survival (PFS) neither differed on univariate analysis (HR, 1.0; P = 0.895) nor on multivariate testing stratified by MSKCC risk group and other established prognostic factors (HR, 1.1; P = 0.806). Everolimus-treated patients with retained (n = 50) versus lost (n = 50) PTEN IHC expression had median PFS of 5.3 months versus 10.5 months (HR, 2.5; P < 0.001). Such differences were not seen with sunitinib (10.9 months vs. 10.3 months; HR, 0.8; P = 0.475). Molecular findings did not correlate with outcomes in gastric and HCC cohorts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAssociation between mutation status for TSC1/TSC2/mTOR and therapeutic outcome on everolimus was not confirmed.

    "pages": "1344-51",
    "abstract": "Among other signals, cell growth is particularly controlled by the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway that includes the tuberous sclerosis complex genes (TSC1/2), and through transcriptional effects regulated by c-myc. Overexpression of Drosophila Myc and TSC1/2 cause opposing growth and proliferation defects. Despite this relationship, direct regulatory connections between Myc and the TSC have only recently been evaluated. Other than studies of p53 regulation, little consideration has been given to transcriptional regulation of the TSC genes. Here we review evidence that transcriptional controls are potentially important regulators of TSC2 expression, and that Myc is a direct repressor of its expression. Since tuberin loss de-represses Myc protein, the connection between these two growth regulators is positioned to act as a feed-forward loop that would amplify the oncogenic effects of decreased tuberin or increased Myc. Further experiments will be needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this important connection, and evaluate its overall contribution to cancers caused by TSC loss or Myc gain.",

    "issue": "5(2)",
    "pages": "90-101",
    "abstract": "Candida albicans is the most common, opportunistic human fungal pathogen whose complex interplay with the host innate immune system remains incompletely understood. In this study, we revealed that infection macrophages with C. albicans triggers prominent cell death, which is largely attributed to the RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Our results further demonstrated that the TSC1-mTOR pathway plays a pivotal role in the control of macrophage necroptosis upon engaging the Dectin-1/2 and TLR-2/4 pathways through fungal components β-glucan/α-mannan or Sel1, respectively. Notably, the rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 pathway, rather than the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 pathway, was responsible for elevated activation of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL in TSC1-deficient macrophages. Following systemic infection with C. albicans, mice with macrophage/neutrophil-specific deletion of Tsc1 (Tsc1 M/N-/-) showed heightened fungal burden in multiple organs, such as the kidney, liver, and spleen, severe morbidity, and mortality. Notably, Tsc1 M/N-/- kidneys exhibited prominent cell death and concomitant loss of tissue-resident macrophages, which likely contributing to a dampened phagocytosis of fungal pathogens. Together, our data demonstrate a crucial role for the TSC1-mTOR pathway in the regulation of macrophage necroptosis and suggest that both Dectin- and TLRs-induced necroptosis may undermine the immune defense effector functions of these innate receptors during C. albicans infection.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 is activated upon genotoxic and oxidative stress and in turn inhibits cell proliferation and growth through induction of specific target genes. Cell growth is positively regulated by mTOR, whose activity is inhibited by the TSC1:TSC2 complex. Although genotoxic stress has been suggested to inhibit mTOR via p53-mediated activation of mTOR inhibitors, the precise mechanism of this link was unknown. We now demonstrate that the products of two p53 target genes, Sestrin1 and Sestrin2, activate the AMP-responsive protein kinase (AMPK) and target it to phosphorylate TSC2 and stimulate its GAP activity, thereby inhibiting mTOR. Correspondingly, Sestrin2-deficient mice fail to inhibit mTOR signaling upon genotoxic challenge. Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 therefore provide an important link between genotoxic stress, p53 and the mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2 regulate the mTOR pathway to control translation and cell growth in response to nutrient and growth factor stimuli. We have recently identified the stress response REDD1 gene as a mediator of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-dependent mTOR regulation by hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that REDD1 inhibits mTOR function to control cell growth in response to energy stress. Endogenous REDD1 is induced following energy stress, and REDD1-/- cells are highly defective in dephosphorylation of the key mTOR substrates S6K and 4E-BP1 following either ATP depletion or direct activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). REDD1 likely acts on the TSC1/2 complex, as regulation of mTOR substrate phosphorylation by REDD1 requires TSC2 and is blocked by overexpression of the TSC1/2 downstream target Rheb but is not blocked by inhibition of AMPK. Tetracycline-inducible expression of REDD1 triggers rapid dephosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 and significantly decreases cellular size. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous REDD1 by short interfering RNA increases cell size in a rapamycin-sensitive manner, and REDD1-/- cells are defective in cell growth regulation following ATP depletion. These results define REDD1 as a critical transducer of the cellular response to energy depletion through the TSC-mTOR pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPolymorphisms or mutations in hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) that increases its activity and stability under normoxia have recently been identified. Likewise, disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 has been shown to result in abnormal accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Here, we investigate the novel polymorphisms in exon 12, that approximate the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha in five cell lines and 28 patients with oral squamous carcinomas. Moreover, we assess for the presence of polymorphisms and mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, to ascertain if dysregulation of such might complement HIF-1alpha expression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDenaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis on PCR fragments in exon 12 of HIF-1alpha from 28 patients with OSCC revealed that 6 of 28 patients had mismatched heteroduplex patterns. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and direct sequencing showed that in 5 of the six cases these changes represented polymorphisms while, one case was a somatic mutation. Analyses of TSC1 and TSC2 revealed heteroduplexes in exons: TSC1 exon 17; TSC2 exons 36, 40, and 41. The relative levels of HIF-1alpha were significantly greater for tumors possessing a HIF-1alpha polymorphism or mutation within exon 12, whereas tumors possessing a deletion or polymorphism in TSC1/TSC2 displayed a trend for higher levels of HIF-1alpha. Western blot analyses for HIF-1alpha, TSC1 and TSC2 in five SCC cell lines revealed high levels of HIF-1alpha in SCC cells possessing TSC1 and/or TSC2 mutations. Wild-type TSC2 cells targeted with siRNA to TSC2 exhibited increased levels of HIF-1alpha. Transfection of a HIF-1alpha mutant produced higher levels of HIF-1alpha in TSC1/TSC2 mutant cell lines than in wild type cells. TSC1/TSC2 mutant cell lines administered Rapamycin blocked S6 phorphorylation and diminished the levels of HIF-1alpha to those observed in cell lines with wild type TSC1/TSC2.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDysregulation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex by mutation compliments HIF-1alpha polymorphisms in the expression of HIF-1alpha in SCC of the head and neck, and may provide biomarkers to predict responses to specific therapies and overall disease prognosis.",

    "issue": "33(24)",
    "pages": "3151-60",
    "abstract": "Mesothelioma is diagnosed in ∼2500 patients in the United States every year, most often arising in the pleural space, but also occurring as primary peritoneal mesothelioma. The vast majority of patients with mesothelioma die of their disease within 3 years. We developed a new mouse model of mesothelioma by bladder or intraperitoneal injection of adenovirus Cre into mice with conditional alleles of each of Tp53 and Tsc1. Such mice began to develop malignant ascites about 6 months after injection, which was due to peritoneal mesothelioma, on the basis of tumor morphology and immunohistochemical staining. Mesothelioma cell lines were established, which showed loss of both Tsc1 and Tp53, with mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)1 activation. Treatment of mice with malignant ascites due to mesothelioma with rapamycin led to a marked reduction in ascites, extended survival and a 95-99% reduction in the mesothelioma tumor volume, in comparison with vehicle-treated mice. To see whether TSC1/TSC2 loss was a common genetic event in human mesothelioma, we examined nine human mesothelioma cell lines, and found that four of nine showed persistent activation of mTORC1, although none had loss of TSC1 or TSC2. A tissue microarray analysis of 198 human mesothelioma specimens showed that 33% of cases had reduced TSC2 expression and 60% showed activation of mTOR, indicating that mTOR activation is common in human mesothelioma, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target.",

    "issue": "7()",
    "pages": "249-57",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a multisystem disease of women, characterized by proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like LAM cells, leading to the formation of lung cysts, fluid-filled cystic structures in the axial lymphatics (eg, lymphangioleiomyomas), and renal angiomyolipomas. LAM is caused by mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode, respectively, hamartin and tuberin, two proteins with a major role in control of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. LAM occurs sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex, an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by widespread hamartomatous lesions. LAM may present with progressive dyspnea, recurrent pneumothorax, or chylothorax. Pulmonary function tests show reduced flow rates (forced expiratory volume in the first second) and diffusion capacity. Exercise testing may reveal gas exchange abnormalities, ventilatory limitation, and hypoxemia. The severity and progression of disease may be assessed by lung histology scores, quantification of computed tomography, pulmonary function testing, 6-minute walk tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and measurement of serum vascular endothelial growth factor D levels. Sirolimus and everolimus, two mTOR inhibitors, are effective in stabilizing lung function and reducing the size of chylous effusions, lymphangioleiomyo-mas, and angiomyolipomas. However, inhibition of mTOR complex 1 increases autophagy, possibly enhancing LAM cell survival. Inhibition of autophagy with hydroxychloroquine, in combination with sirolimus, has been proposed as a possible treatment for LAM. Deficiency of tuberin results in increased RhoA GTPase activity and cell survival, an effect that is mediated through mTOR complex 2 signaling. Because sirolimus and everolimus only affect the activity of mTOR complex 1, therapies targeting RhoA GTPases with simvastatin, which inhibits Rho GTPases and promotes apoptosis, are being investigated. As in the case of cancer, LAM may be best treated with multiple drugs targeting signaling pathways considered important in the pathogenesis of disease.",

    "abstract": "Germline and somatic biallelic mutations of the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and TSC2 gene products cause TSC, an autosomal dominant multifocal hamartomatosis with variable neurological manifestations. The consequences of TSC1 or TSC2 loss in cells of hematopoietic origin have recently started to be unveiled in mice and showed to hinder the development of proper T cell immunity. To date, the consequences of germline TSC1 mutations and/or its loss in mature human T cells remain to be determined. To address these issues, we analyzed subset representation, phenotype and responsiveness to mitogens in T cells from patients with inherited monoallelic TSC1 mutations, and induced shRNA-mediated TSC1 down-regulation in primary and transformed human T cells. We report that, the distribution of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, their cytokine-secretion profile, and responsiveness to in vitro stimulation were largely preserved in TSC subjects with monoallelic TSC1 germline mutations when compared to healthy controls. Sufficient levels of hamartin and tuberin and proper control of mTOR-dependent signaling in primary T cells from TSC subjects best explained this. In contrast, shRNA-induced down-regulation of TSC1, likely mimicking biallelic inactivation of TSC1, compromised hamartin and tuberin expression and mTORC2/AKT/FoxO1/3 signaling causing both primary and transformed T cells to die by apoptosis. Thus, our results indicate that, while one functional TSC1 allele preserves human T lymphocytes development and homeostasis, TSC1 acute down-regulation is detrimental to the survival of both primary and transformed T cells.",

While mTOR has been shown to play an important role in health and aging, the role of TSC1/2 in aging has not been fully investigated. In the current study, a constitutive TSC1 transgenic (Tsc1 tg ) mouse model was generated and characterized. mTORC1 signaling was reduced in majority of the tissues, except the brain. In contrast, mTORC2 signaling was enhanced in Tsc1 tg mice. Tsc1 tg mice are more tolerant to exhaustive exercises and less susceptible to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy at both young and advanced ages. Tsc1 tg mice have less fibrosis and inflammation in aged as well as isoproterenol-challenged heart than age-matched wild type mice. The female Tsc1 tg mice exhibit a higher fat to lean mass ratio at advanced ages than age-matched wild type mice. More importantly, the lifespan increased significantly in female Tsc1 tg mice, but not in male Tsc1 tg mice. Collectively, our data demonstrated that moderate increase of TSC1 expression can enhance overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, and improve survival in a gender-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells adapt to different environmental conditions and alter cellular metabolic pathways to meet the energy demand for survival. Thus, the metabolic regulation of cells under special conditions, such as hypoxia, should be precisely regulated. During the metabolic regulation, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a vital role in the sensing of extracellular stimulations and regulating intracellular adaptations. Here, we report that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling is a central regulator of lipid homoeostasis in lymphocytes. In hypoxia, mTORC1 activity is reduced and shifts lipid synthesis to lipid oxidation. Moreover, knockdown tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) constitutively activates mTORC1 activity and impairs the hypoxia-induced metabolic shift. Therefore, TSC1 knockdown enhances hypoxia-induced cell death. Re-inactivation of mTORC1 activity via rapamycin may resist hypoxia-induced cell death in TSC1 knockdown lymphocytes. Our findings provide a deep insight into mTORC1 in the metabolic balance of lipid synthesis and oxidation, and imply that mTORC1 activity should be precisely regulated for the lipid homoeostasis in lymphocytes.",

    "title": "Analysis of TSC1 mutation spectrum in mucosal melanoma.",
    "issue": "144(2)",
    "pages": "257-267",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nMucosal melanoma is a relatively rare subtype of melanoma for which no clearly established therapeutic strategy exists. The genes of the mTOR signalling pathway have drawn great attention as key targets for cancer treatment, including melanoma. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mutation status of the upstream mTOR regulator TSC1 and evaluated its correlation with the clinicopathological features of mucosal melanoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected 91 mucosal melanoma samples for detecting TSC1 mutations. All the coding exons of TSC1 were amplified by PCR and subjected to Sanger sequencing. Expression level of TSC1 encoding protein (hamartin) was detected by immunohistochemistry. The activation of mTOR pathway was determined by evaluating the phosphorylation status of S6RP and 4E-BP1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall mutation frequency of TSC1 was found to be 17.6% (16/91 patients). TSC1 mutations were more inclined to occur in advanced mucosal melanoma (stages III and IV). In the 16 patients with TSC1 mutations, 14 different mutations were detected, affecting 11 different exons. TSC1 mutations were correlated with upregulation of S6RP phosphorylation but were unrelated to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation or hamartin expression. Mucosal melanoma patients with TSC1 mutations had a worse outcome than patients without TSC1 mutations (24.0 versus 34.0 months, P = 0.007).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that TSC1 mutations are frequent in mucosal melanoma. TSC1 mutations can activate the mTOR pathway through phospho-S6RP and might be a poor prognostic predictor of mucosal melanoma. Our data implicate the potential significance of TSC1 mutations for effective and specific drug therapy for mucosal melanoma.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and is associated with hamartoma formation in multiple organ systems. Brain disorders are the origin of more frequent and severe problems and include infantile spasms, intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, cognitive disabilities, and autism. TSC1 or TSC2 encoded proteins modulate cell function via the mTOR signaling cascade and serve as keystones in regulating cell growth and proliferation. AIM. To review the etiopathogenic mechanisms and the natural course of the association of autism and epilepsy in TSC.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nBoth the clinical and the neuroimaging findings of TSC, including early onset epilepsy and the localization of cortical tubers in the temporal lobes, and the molecular understanding of the mTOR signaling pathway, not only involved in cell growth, but also in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and neuronal functioning, have suggested a multimodal origin of autism in these patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA greater understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying autism in TSC could help in devising targeted and potentially more effective treatment strategies. Antagonism of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin and everolimus may provide new therapeutic options for these TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the lung resident macrophages critically involved in pulmonary homeostasis and immune response. Recent researches have uncovered a diversity of regulators responsible for the development, maintenance, and function of AMs. Nevertheless, the molecular underpinnings that determine the developmental and functional specification of AMs remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of the TSC1-mTOR pathway in murine AMs by genetic ablating Tsc1 or mTor alleles through Cd11c-Cre or LysM-Cre. Flow cytometry analyses revealed a prominent decrease in AMs in Tsc1f/f-Cd11c-Cre and Tsc1f/f/-LysM-Cre mice. Moreover, a reduction in AMs was also noted in mTorf/f-Cd11c-Cre or Rptorf/f-Cd11c-Cre mice. Further evidence implicated that elevation in cell death, most likely aberrant apoptosis or/and necroptosis, might be attributable to disrupted AM homeostasis. Whereas a diversity of cytokines involved in AM homeostasis and function triggered mTOR activation, only the IL-13 signaling, particularly Jak1 and Stat3 activation, was affected by TSC1 in macrophages. Further, select genes induced by IL-13, including AM surface markers such as Pparg, Fabp4/5, Nfil3 and Car4, and M2 hallmarks such as Arg1, Fizz, Ym1 and Clec7a were fine-tuned by the TSC1-mTOR pathway. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the TSC1-mTOR pathway has a crucial role in the homeostasis and functional specification of AMs through integrating cytokine signaling with metabolic cues.",

    "issue": "50(5)",
    "pages": "1804-1814",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nMiR-19b has been reported to be involved in several malignancies, but its role in multiple myeloma (MM) is still unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the biological mechanism of miR-19b in the progression of MM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFirst, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot to study the expression of miR-19b, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), and caspase-3 in different groups. MTT assay was performed to explore the effect of miR-19b on survival and apoptosis of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Computation analysis and luciferase assay were utilized to confirm the interaction between miR-19b and TSC1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 38 participants comprising 20 subjects with MM and 18 healthy subjects as normal controls were enrolled in our study. Real-time PCR showed dramatic upregulation of miR-19b, but TSC1 was evidently suppressed in the MM group. MiR-19b overexpression substantially promoted clonogenicity and cell viability, and further inhibited apoptosis of CSCs in vitro. Furthermore, miR-19b overexpression downregulated the expression of caspase-3, which induced apoptosis. Using in silico analysis, we identified that TSC1 might be a direct downstream target of miR-19b, and this was further confirmed by luciferase assay showing that miR-19b apparently reduced the luciferase activity of wild-type TSC1 3´-UTR, but not that of mutant TSC1 3´-UTR. There was also evident decrease in TSC1 mRNA and protein in CSCs following introduction of miR-19b. Interestingly, reintroduction of TSC1 abolished the miR-19b-induced proliferation promotion and apoptosis inhibition in CSCs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings collectively suggest that miR-19b promotes cell survival and suppresses apoptosis of MM CSCs via targeting TSC1 directly, indicating that miR-19b may serve as a potential and novel therapeutic target of MM based on miRNA expression.",

    "title": "TSC1 Affects the Process of Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Controlling Macrophage Polarization.",
    "issue": "12()",
    "pages": "637335",
    "abstract": "Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI), increases morbidity and mortality, and is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Macrophage infiltration is a common feature after renal IRI, and infiltrating macrophages can be polarized into the following two distinct types: M1 macrophages, i.e., classically activated macrophages, which can not only inhibit infection but also accelerate renal injury, and M2 macrophages, i.e., alternatively activated macrophages, which have a repair phenotype that can promote wound healing and subsequent fibrosis. The role of TSC1, which is a negative regulator of mTOR signaling that regulates macrophage polarization in inflammation-linked diseases, has been well documented, but whether TSC1 contributes to macrophage polarization in the process of IRI is still unknown. Here, by using a mouse model of renal ischemia-reperfusion, we found that myeloid cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice (termed Lyz-TSC1 cKO mice) had higher serum creatinine levels, more severe histological damage, and greater proinflammatory cytokine production than wild-type (WT) mice during the early phase after renal ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, the Lyz-TSC1 cKO mice showed attenuated renal fibrosis during the repair phase of IRI with decreased levels of M2 markers on macrophages in the operated kidneys, which was further confirmed in a cell model of hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro. Mechanistically, by using RNA sequencing of sorted renal macrophages, we found that the expression of most M1-related genes was upregulated in the Lyz-TSC1 cKO group (Supplemental Table 1) during the early phase. However, C/EBPβ and CD206 expression was decreased during the repair phase compared to in the WT group. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the expression of TSC1 in macrophages contributes to the whole process of IRI but serves as an inflammation suppressor during the early phase and a fibrosis promoter during the repair phase.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in genes encoding either hamartin [TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1)] or tuberin (TSC2) result in a multisystem disorder characterized by the development of benign tumours and hamartomas in several organs. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a complex that lies at the crossroad of many signalling pathways integrating the energy status of the cell with signals induced by nutrients and growth factors. The TSC1/2 complex is a critical negative regulator of mTORC1 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex 1], and by that controls anabolic processes to promote cell growth, proliferation and survival. In the present paper, we review recent evidence highlighting the notion that the TSC1/2 complex simultaneously controls mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent signals critical for the balancing of cell proliferation and cell death.",

    "issue": "303(4)",
    "pages": "F584-92",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multiorgan hamartomatous disease caused by loss of function mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Neurological symptoms of TSC predominate in younger patients, but renal pathologies are a serious aspect of the disease in older children and adults. To study TSC pathogenesis in the kidney, we inactivated the mouse Tsc1 gene in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT). At young ages, Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mice have enlarged kidneys and mild cystogenesis with increased mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduces kidney size and cystogenesis. Rapamycin withdrawal led to massive cystogenesis involving both distal as well as proximal tubules. To assess the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling in kidney pathogenesis, we also generated Rictor CKO mice. These animals did not have any detectable kidney pathology. Finally, we examined primary cilia in the DCT. Cilia were longer in Tsc1 CKO mice, and rapamycin treatment returned cilia length to normal. Rictor CKO mice had normal cilia in the DCT. Overall, our findings suggest that loss of the Tsc1 gene in the DCT is sufficient for renal cystogenesis. This cytogenesis appears to be mTORC1 but not mTORC2 dependent. Intriguingly, the mechanism may be cell autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous and possibly involves the length and function of primary cilia.",

    "issue": "2(11)",
    "pages": "e1217",
    "abstract": "TOR (Target of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of cell growth. TOR is found in two functionally and structurally distinct multiprotein complexes termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) based proteomic strategy to identify new mammalian TOR (mTOR) binding proteins. We report the identification of Proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40) and the hypothetical protein Q6MZQ0/FLJ14213/CAE45978 as new mTOR binding proteins. PRAS40 binds mTORC1 via Raptor, and is an mTOR phosphorylation substrate. PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 autophosphorylation and mTORC1 kinase activity toward eIF-4E binding protein (4E-BP) and PRAS40 itself. HeLa cells in which PRAS40 was knocked down were protected against induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide. Rapamycin failed to mimic the pro-apoptotic effect of PRAS40, suggesting that PRAS40 mediates apoptosis independently of its inhibitory effect on mTORC1. Q6MZQ0 is structurally similar to proline rich protein 5 (PRR5) and was therefore named PRR5-Like (PRR5L). PRR5L binds specifically to mTORC2, via Rictor and/or SIN1. Unlike other mTORC2 members, PRR5L is not required for mTORC2 integrity or kinase activity, but dissociates from mTORC2 upon knock down of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2. Hyperactivation of mTOR by TSC1/2 knock down enhanced apoptosis whereas PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis. PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis also in mTORC2 deficient cells. The above suggests that mTORC2-dissociated PRR5L may promote apoptosis when mTOR is hyperactive. Thus, PRAS40 and PRR5L are novel mTOR-associated proteins that control the balance between cell growth and cell death.",

    "abstract": "The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha is one of the factors that links obesity-derived chronic inflammation with insulin resistance. Activation of mTOR signaling pathway has been found to suppress insulin sensitivity through serine phosphorylation and the inhibition of IRS1 by mTOR and its downstream effector, S6K1. It remains elusive that whether the mTOR pathway has a role in TNFalpha-mediated insulin resistance. In the present study, we demonstrated that TNFalpha-IKKbeta-mediated inactivation of TSC1 resulted in increasing phosphorylation of IRS1 serine 307 and serine 636/639, impaired insulin-induced glucose uptake, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, and the association between IRS1 and PI3K p85. Furthermore, a higher expression of pIKKbeta (S181), pTSC1(S511), and pS6(S240/244) was found in livers obtained from both C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet and B6.V-Lepob/J mice. Collectively, dysregulation of the TSC1/ TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway by IKKbeta is a common molecular switch for both cancer pathogenesis and diet- and obesity-induced insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "We herein report that deletion of mTOR in dental epithelia caused defective development of multiple cell layers of the enamel organ, which culminated in tooth malformation and cystogenesis. Specifically, cells of the stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium were poorly formed, resulting in cystic changes. The pre-ameloblasts failed to elongate along the apical-basal axis and persisted vigorous expression of Sox2 and P63, which are normally downregulated during cytodifferentiation. Expression of amelogenic markers was also attenuated in mutants. Cell proliferation and cell sizes in mutants were significantly reduced over time. Importantly, we found reduced amounts and aberrant aggregations of cytoskeletal components in mutants, along with attenuated expression of cytoskeleton regulator Cdc42, whose epithelial deletion causes a similar phenotype. Moreover, disruption of actin assembly in an organ culture system affected cell proliferation and cytodifferentiation of tooth germs, supporting a causative role of mTOR-regulated cytoskeleton dynamics for the observed phenotype of mTOR mutant mice. In further support of this view, we showed that mTOR overactivation caused increased cytoskeletal component synthesis and assembly, along with accelerated cytodifferentiation in the enamel organ. Finally, we demonstrated that mTOR regulated enamel organ development principally through the mTORC1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the main cells involved in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesion (PanIN). Fine-tuning the precise molecular targets in PSC activation might help the development of PSC-specific therapeutic strategies to tackle progression of pancreatic cancer-related fibrosis. miR-301a is a pro-inflammatory microRNA known to be activated by multiple inflammatory factors in the tumor stroma. Here, we show that miR-301a is highly expressed in activated PSCs in mice, sustained tissue fibrosis in caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis, and accelerated PanIN formation. Genetic ablation of miR-301a reduced pancreatic fibrosis in mouse models with chronic pancreatitis and PanIN. Cell proliferation and activation of PSCs was inhibited by downregulation of miR-301a via two of its targets, Tsc1 and Gadd45g. Moreover, aberrant PSC expression of miR-301a and Gadd45g restricted the interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells in tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that miR-301a activates two major cell proliferation pathways, Tsc1/mTOR and Gadd45g/Stat3, in vivo, to facilitate development of inflammatory-induced PanIN and maintenance of PSC activation and desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "TSC-mTOR signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and survival control. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that forms two distinct functional complexes, termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2, respectively. TORC1 is a rapamycin-sensitive complex and regulates a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription, and autophagy. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene products, TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors and specifically suppress TORC1 activity. Mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 causes TSC disease, which is characterized by formation of hamartomas in multiple organs. Although the role of TSC-mTOR pathway in tumor and cancer development has been extensively studied, more recent studies have indicated a role for mTOR function in appetite, memory, aging, and energy metabolism. Dysregulation of the TSC-mTOR pathway may cause not only tumor development but also metabolic disorders such as diabetes and its complications.",

Cell Rep. 2017;21:3754-3766. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME) are epileptogenic neurodevelopmental malformations caused by mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Deep sequencing of these genes in FCD/HME brain tissue identified an etiology in 27 (41%) of 66 cases. Radiographically indistinguishable lesions are caused by somatic activating mutations in AKT3, MTOR, and PIK3CA and germline loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5, NPRL2, and TSC1/2, including TSC2 mutations in isolated HME demonstrating a \"two-hit\" model. Mutations in the same gene cause a disease continuum from FCD to HME to bilateral brain overgrowth, reflecting the progenitor cell and developmental time when the mutation occurred. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated mTOR activation in neurons in all lesions. Conditional Pik3ca activation in the mouse cortex showed that mTOR activation in excitatory neurons and glia, but not interneurons, is sufficient for abnormal cortical overgrowth. These data suggest that mTOR activation in dorsal telencephalic progenitors, in some cases specifically the excitatory neuron lineage, causes cortical dysplasia.",

Aberrant hyperactivation of mTOR as a consequence of loss-of-function gene mutations encoding mTOR inhibitor proteins such as TSC1, TSC2, PTEN and STRADα has been recently linked to developmental cortical malformations associated with epilepsy and neurobehavioral disabilities. Investigation of mTOR signaling in these disorders provides for the first time exciting future avenues for assessment of biomarkers, patient stratification and prognostic measures as well as the opportunity for targeted therapy to regulate mTOR activity across all age groups.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders affect a significant portion of the world's population leading to either disability or death for almost 30 million individuals worldwide. One novel therapeutic target that may offer promise for multiple disease entities that involve Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, trauma, stroke, and tumors of the nervous system is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR signaling is dependent upon the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes that are composed of mTOR and several regulatory proteins including the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1, hamartin/TSC2, tuberin). Through a number of integrated cell signaling pathways that involve those of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as well as more novel signaling tied to cytokines, Wnt, and forkhead, mTOR can foster stem cellular proliferation, tissue repair and longevity, and synaptic growth by modulating mechanisms that foster both apoptosis and autophagy. Yet, mTOR through its proliferative capacity may sometimes be detrimental to central nervous system recovery and even promote tumorigenesis. Further knowledge of mTOR and the critical pathways governed by this serine/threonine protein kinase can bring new light for neurodegeneration and other related diseases that currently require new and robust treatments.",

    "title": "TSC1 controls distribution of actin fibers through its effect on function of Rho family of small GTPases and regulates cell migration and polarity.",
    "issue": "8(1)",
    "pages": "e54503",
    "abstract": "The tumor-suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2 are mutated in tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a protein complex that inhibits the signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) pathway. mTORC1 is a crucial molecule in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and survival. When the TSC1/TSC2 complex is not functional, uncontrolled mTORC1 activity accelerates the cell cycle and triggers tumorigenesis. Recent studies have suggested that TSC1 and TSC2 also regulate the activities of Rac1 and Rho, members of the Rho family of small GTPases, and thereby influence the ensuing actin cytoskeletal organization at focal adhesions. However, how TSC1 contributes to the establishment of cell polarity is not well understood. Here, the relationship between TSC1 and the formation of the actin cytoskeleton was analyzed in stable TSC1-expressing cell lines originally established from a Tsc1-deficient mouse renal tumor cell line. Our analyses showed that cell proliferation and migration were suppressed when TSC1 was expressed. Rac1 activity in these cells was also decreased as was formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. Furthermore, the number of basal actin stress fibers was reduced; by contrast, apical actin fibers, originating at the level of the tight junction formed a network in TSC1-expressing cells. Treatment with Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor diminished the number of apical actin fibers, but rapamycin had no effect. Thus, the actin fibers were regulated by the Rho-ROCK pathway independently of mTOR. In addition, apical actin fibers appeared in TSC1-deficient cells after inhibition of Rac1 activity. These results suggest that TSC1 regulates cell polarity-associated formation of actin fibers through the spatial regulation of Rho family of small GTPases.",

    "pages": "1406-14",
    "abstract": "Chordomas are radio- and chemo-resistant tumours and metastasise in as many as 40% of patients. The aim of this study was to identify potential molecular targets for the treatment of chordoma. In view of the reported association of chordoma and tuberous sclerosis complex syndrome, and the available therapeutic agents against molecules in the PI3K/AKT/TSC1/TSC2/mTOR pathway, a tissue microarray of 50 chordoma cases was analysed for expression of active molecules involved in this signalling pathway by immunohistochemistry and a selected number by western blot analysis. Chordomas were positive for p-AKT (92%), p-TSC2 (96%), p-mTOR (27%), total mTOR (75%), p-p70S6K (62%), p-RPS6 (22%), p-4E-BP1 (96%) and eIF-4E (98%). Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 expression was lost in 16% of cases. Mutations failed to be identified in PI3KCA and RHEB1 in the 23 cases for which genomic DNA was available. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for mTOR and RPS6 loci showed that 11 of 33 and 21 of 44 tumours had loss of one copy of the respective genes, results which correlated with the loss of the relevant total proteins. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis for loci containing TSC1 and TSC2 revealed that all cases analysed harboured two copies of the respective genes. On the basis of p-mTOR and or p-p70S6K expression there is evidence indicating that 65% of the chordomas studied may be responsive to mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin or its analogues, and that patients may benefit from combined therapy including drugs that inhibit AKT.",

    "issue": "35()",
    "pages": "35-41",
    "abstract": "The IGF-I/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, metabolism and protein synthesis. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is synthesized in the liver and fibroblasts, and its biological actions are mediated by the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). The binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Activated PI3K stimulates the production of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3]. The PH domain of AKT (protein kinase B, PKB) (v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) binds to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, followed by phosphorylation of the Thr308 and Ser473 regulatory sites. Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are upstream regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downstream effectors of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The activation of AKT suppresses the TSC1/TSC2 heterodimer, which is an upstream regulator of mTOR. Dysregulated IGF-I/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling has been shown to be associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this review, we discuss the emerging evidence for a functional relationship between the IGF-I/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and ASDs, as well as a possible role of this signaling pathway in the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant monogenetic disorder that is characterized by the formation of benign tumors in several organs as well as brain malformations and neuronal defects. TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in one of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, resulting in increased activity of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Here, we explore the cytoarchitectural and functional CNS aberrations that may account for the neurological presentations of TSC, notably seizures, hydrocephalus, and cognitive and psychological impairments. In particular, recent mouse models of brain lesions are presented with an emphasis on using electroporation to allow the generation of discrete lesions resulting from loss of heterozygosity during perinatal development. Cortical lesions are thought to contribute to epileptogenesis and worsening of cognitive defects. However, it has recently been suggested that being born with a mutant allele without loss of heterozygosity and associated cortical lesions is sufficient to generate cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems. We will thus discuss the function of mTOR hyperactivity on neuronal circuit formation and the potential consequences of being born heterozygous on neuronal function and the biochemistry of synaptic plasticity, the cellular substrate of learning and memory. Ultimately, a major goal of TSC research is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms downstream of mTOR underlying the neurological manifestations observed in TSC patients and identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent the formation of brain lesions and restore neuronal function.",

    "title": "Efficacy of combined inhibition of mTOR and ERK/MAPK pathways in treating a tuberous sclerosis complex cell model.",
    "issue": "36(6)",
    "pages": "355-61",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome which afflicts multiple organs and for which there is no cure, such that TSC patients may develop severe mental retardation and succumb to renal or respiratory failure. TSC derives from inactivating mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene, and the resulting inactivation of the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex causes hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Recent clinical trials of targeted suppression of mTOR have yielded only modest success in TSC patients. It was proposed that abrogation of a newly identified mTOR-mediated negative feedback regulation on extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway and on the well-documented RTK-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade could limit the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of TSC patients. Therefore, we speculate that dual inhibition of mTOR and ERK/MAPK pathways may overcome the disadvantage of single agent therapies and boost the efficacy of mTOR targeted therapies for TSC patients. Investigation of this hypothesis in a TSC cell model revealed that mTOR suppression with an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (sirolimus), led to up-regulation of ERK/MAPK signaling in mouse Tsc2 knockout cells and that this augmented signaling was attenuated by concurrent administration of a MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059. When compared with monotherapy, combinatorial application of rapamycin and PD98059 had greater inhibitory effects on Tsc2 deficient cell proliferation, suggesting that combined suppression of mTOR and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may have advantages over single mTOR inhibition in the treatment of TSC patients.",

    "pages": "197",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCollision tumors are uncommon but well described clinical entities composed of distinct tumor histologies occurring within the same anatomic site. Optimal management of patients with collision tumors remains highly variable and depends on clinical characteristics such as the involved tumor types, predominant histology, as well as the extent of disease. Comprehensive genomic profiling is a means of identifying genomic alterations to suggest benefit from targeted therapy.\n\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nA 78-year-old woman presented to medical oncology with liver metastases occurring within the background of a 1-year history of uveal melanoma. Biopsy of the liver metastases revealed presence of adenocarcinoma along with nests of malignant melanoma consistent with a collision tumor. The disease was refractory to several lines of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the patient later developed pulmonary metastases while on chemotherapy. The patient's tumor tissue was assayed by comprehensive genomic profiling which revealed presence of a TSC1 partial loss. The patient was subsequently initiated on temsirolimus 15 mg intravenously weekly for 4 months. Restaging imaging demonstrated a partial response to therapy by RECIST 1.1 criteria and clinical benefit for 6 months until the patient passed away secondary to unrelated causes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe report the first case of a collision tumor composed of adenocarcinoma and melanoma with a TSC1 mutation that objectively and durably responded to mTOR inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway in 54 patients with typical carcinoid tumours (TC) or atypical carcinoid tumours (AC). In total, 54 bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumour (NET) surgical specimens, consisting of 17 TC, 8 AC, 17 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and 12 small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) samples, were tested for mTOR by immunohistochemistry, and 104 exon sites were tested in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by nested polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the positive rates for mTOR expression in TC/AC and LCNEC/SCLC were 60 (15/25) and 55.2% (16/29), respectively. In total, 4 missense mutations were found in 3 patients with TC/AC, including mutations in exon 48 of mTOR (c.6667C>T), exon 21 of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 (c.2765G>A), and exons 12 (c.1265C>T) and 19 (c.2148C>T) of TSC2. To the best of our knowledge, mutations in exon 48 of mTOR and exon 21 of TSC1 have not been previously reported. Tissues from patients with single mutations exhibited strong positive mTOR immunohistochemical staining, and tissues from patients with double mutations were weakly positive. The same mutations were not observed in SCLC or LCNEC. In conclusion, gene mutations were observed and an association between the gene mutations and mTOR expression were indicated in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TC/AC tumours. Those mutations may be driver genes and treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic/ischemic preconditioning (HPC/IPC) is an innate neuroprotective mechanism in which a number of endogenous molecules are known to be involved. Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), also known as hamartin, is thought to be one such molecule. It is also known that hamartin is involved as a target in the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which functions to integrate a variety of environmental triggers in order to exert control over cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Understanding the role of hamartin in ischemic/hypoxic neuroprotection will provide a novel target for the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic disease. Therefore, the proposed molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective role and its preconditions are reviewed in this paper, with emphases on the mTOR pathway and the relationship between the expression of hamartin and DNA methylation.",

    "issue": "31(9)",
    "pages": "1870-84",
    "abstract": "mTORC1 is a critical regulator of cell growth that integrates multiple signals and is deregulated in cancer. We previously reported that mTORC1 regulation by hypoxia involves Redd1 and the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex. Here we show that Redd1 induction by hypoxia is tissue dependent and that hypoxia signals are relayed to mTORC1 through different pathways in a tissue-specific manner. In the liver, Redd1 induction is restricted to the centrilobular area, and in primary hepatocytes, mTORC1 inhibition by hypoxia is independent of Redd1. Furthermore, Tsc1/Tsc2 and Arnt (Hif-1β) are similarly dispensable. Hypoxia signaling in hepatocytes involves Lkb1, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and raptor. Differences in signal relay extend beyond hypoxia and involve AMPK signaling. AMPK activation (using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside [AICAR]) induces raptor phosphorylation and inhibits mTORC1 in both mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and hepatocytes, but whereas mTORC1 inhibition is Tsc1/Tsc2 dependent in MEFs, it is independent in hepatocytes. In liver cells, raptor phosphorylation is essential for both AMPK and hypoxia signaling. Thus, context-specific signals are required for raptor phosphorylation-induced mTORC1 inhibition. Our data illustrate a heretofore unappreciated topological complexity in mTORC1 regulation. Interestingly, topological differences in mTORC1 regulation by the tumor suppressor proteins Lkb1 and Tsc1/Tsc2 may underlie their tissue specificity of tumor suppressor action.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressors Tsc1 and Tsc2 form the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a regulator of mTOR activity. Tsc1 stabilizes Tsc2; however, the precise mechanism involved remains elusive. The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential component of the cellular homeostatic machinery in eukaryotes. Here, we show that Tsc1 is a new co-chaperone for Hsp90 that inhibits its ATPase activity. The C-terminal domain of Tsc1 (998-1,164 aa) forms a homodimer and binds to both protomers of the Hsp90 middle domain. This ensures inhibition of both subunits of the Hsp90 dimer and prevents the activating co-chaperone Aha1 from binding the middle domain of Hsp90. Conversely, phosphorylation of Aha1-Y223 increases its affinity for Hsp90 and displaces Tsc1, thereby providing a mechanism for equilibrium between binding of these two co-chaperones to Hsp90. Our findings establish an active role for Tsc1 as a facilitator of Hsp90-mediated folding of kinase and non-kinase clients-including Tsc2-thereby preventing their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 and TSC2 are two recently identified tumour suppressor genes encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively, and involved in pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis, neurological disorder connected with the development of hamartomas in numerous organ systems, including the brain, kidneys, heart and liver. Both protein products of TSC1 and TSC2 form an intracellular complex exerting GTPase-activating (GAP) activity towards a small G protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). Inhibition of Rheb is important for the regulation of mTOR pathway, while mutation of hamartin or tuberin results in uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Tuberin, possessing the Rheb-GAP domain, is phosphorylated by several kinases that confer the signals of growth factor stimulation or low cellular energy levels. Such a modification of tuberin influences its activity within the complex with hamartin and positively or negatively modulates mTOR-regulated protein translation and cellular proliferation. Current article describes biochemical properties of hamartin and tuberin, their known regulatory phosphorylation sites and binding partners.",

Mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes determin overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and subsequent abnormalities in numerous cell processes. As a result, mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus have the potential to provide targeted therapy for TSC patients. Everolimus has been recently approved as a pharmacotherapy option for TSC patients with subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) or renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). However, clinical evidence suggests that this treatment can benefit other TSC-associated disease manifestations, such as skin manifestations, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and epilepsy. Therefore, the positive effects that mTOR inhibition have on a wide variety of TSC disease manifestations make this a potential systemic treatment option for this genetic multifaceted disorder.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (Lgi1), a putative tumor suppressor, is tightly associated with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). It has been shown that Lgi1 regulates the myelination of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the function and underlying mechanisms for Lgi1 regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. In addition, whether Lgi1 is required for myelin maintenance is unknown. Here, we show that Lgi1 is necessary and sufficient for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and is also required for the maintenance of myelinated fibers. The hypomyelination in Lgi1-/- mice attributes to the inhibition of the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins in oligodendrocytes (OLs). Moreover, we found that Lgi1 deficiency leads to a decrease in expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and activates mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Together, the present work establishes that Lgi1 is a regulator of oligodendrocyte development and myelination in CNS.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by heterozygous mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, frequently results in intractable epilepsy. Here, we made use of an inducible Tsc1-knockout mouse model, allowing us to study electrophysiological and molecular changes of Tsc1-induced epileptogenesis over time. We recorded from pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex (L2/L3) and combined this with an analysis of transcriptome changes during epileptogenesis. Deletion of Tsc1 resulted in hippocampus-specific changes in excitability and adaptation, which emerged before seizure onset and progressed over time. All phenotypes were rescued after early treatment with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. Later in epileptogenesis, we observed a hippocampal increase of excitation-to-inhibition ratio. These cellular changes were accompanied by dramatic transcriptional changes, especially after seizure onset. Most of these changes were rescued upon rapamycin treatment. Of the genes encoding ion channels or belonging to the Gene Ontology term action potential, 27 were differentially expressed just before seizure onset, suggesting a potential driving role in epileptogenesis. Our data highlight the complex changes driving epileptogenesis in TSC, including the changed expression of multiple ion channels. Our study emphasizes inhibition of the TSC/mTOR signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic approach to target epilepsy in patients with TSC.",

    "pages": "436-446",
    "abstract": "Loss of TSC1 function, a crucial negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is a common alteration in bladder cancer. Mutations in other members of the PI3K pathway, leading to mTOR activation, are also found in bladder cancer. This provides rationale for targeting mTOR for treatment of bladder cancer characterized by TSC1 mutations and/or mTOR activation. In this study, we asked whether combination treatment with rapamycin and resveratrol could be effective in concurrently inhibiting mTOR and PI3K signaling and inducing cell death in bladder cancer cells. In combination with rapamycin, resveratrol was able to block rapamycin-induced Akt activation, while maintaining mTOR pathway inhibition. In addition, combination treatment with rapamycin and resveratrol induced cell death specifically in TSC1-/- MEF cells, and not in wild-type MEFs. Similarly, resveratrol alone or in combination with rapamycin induced cell death in human bladder cancer cell lines. These data indicate that administration of resveratrol together with rapamycin may be a promising therapeutic option for treatment of bladder cancer. J. Cell.

    "title": "Cathepsin K: A Novel Diagnostic and Predictive Biomarker for Renal Tumors.",
    "issue": "13(10)",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "Cathepsin K is a papain-like cysteine protease with high matrix-degrading activity. Among several cathepsins, cathepsin K is the most potent mammalian collagenase, mainly expressed by osteoclasts. This review summarizes most of the recent findings of cathepsin K expression, highlighting its role in renal tumors for diagnostic purposes and as a potential molecular target. Indeed, cathepsin K is a recognized diagnostic tool for the identification of TFE3/TFEB-rearranged renal cell carcinoma, TFEB-amplified renal cell carcinoma, and pure epithelioid PEComa/epithelioid angiomyolipoma. More recently, its expression has been observed in a subgroup of eosinophilic renal neoplasms molecularly characterized by TSC/mTOR gene mutations. Interestingly, both TSC mutations or TFE3 rearrangement have been reported in pure epithelioid PEComa/epithelioid angiomyolipoma. Therefore, cathepsin K seems to be a downstream marker of TFE3/TFEB rearrangement, TFEB amplification, and mTOR pathway activation. Given the established role of mTOR inhibitors as a pharmacological option in renal cancers, cathepsin K could be of use as a predictive marker of therapy response and as a potential target. In the future, uropathologists may implement the use of cathepsin K to establish a diagnosis among renal tumors with clear cells, papillary architecture, and oncocytic features.",

    "issue": "69(2)",
    "pages": "860-875",
    "abstract": "Gastric mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is inversely associated with the expression and secretion of ghrelin, a 28-aa peptide hormone produced by gastric X/A-like cells. Ghrelin contributes to obesity and hepatic steatosis. We sought to control global lipid metabolism via the manipulation of gastric mTOR signaling in X/A-like cells. We established a ghrl-cre transgene in which the Cre enzyme is expressed in X/A-like cells under the control of the ghrelin-promoter. mTORflox/flox and tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)flox/flox mice were separately bred with ghrl-cre mice to generate mTOR-ghrl-cre or TSC1-ghrl-cre mice, within which mTOR signaling was suppressed or activated, respectively. Lipid metabolism in liver and adipose depots was analyzed. Under the control of the ghrelin-promoter, the Cre enzyme was exclusively expressed in stomach X/A-like cells in adult animals. Knockout of mTOR in X/A-like cells increased circulating acyl-ghrelin and promoted hepatic lipogenesis with effects on adipose depots. Activation of mTOR signaling by deletion of its upstream inhibitor, TSC1, decreased ghrelin expression and secretion, altering lipid metabolism as evidenced by resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. Both ghrelin administration and injection of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, altered the phenotypes of TSC1-ghrl-cre mice. Conclusion: Gastric mTOR signaling in X/A-like cells contributes to organism lipid homeostasis by regulating hepatic and adipose lipid metabolism. Gastric mTOR signaling may provide an alternative strategy for intervention in lipid disorders.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that alterations in mTOR pathway genes were correlated with response to rapalog therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), when the analysis focused on extremes of response. Herein, we expand on the prior cohort and examine genetic correlations with rapalog response in a dataset not selected for extremes of response. Tumors from 58 patients from the phase III trial of temsirolimus and 51 local patients with mRCC treated with rapalogs were studied. Somatic mutations were investigated using a targeted sequencing platform covering 27 genes. Clinical benefit (CB) was defined as patients with complete remission, partial response, or stable disease lasting at least 22 weeks. Mutational analyses focused on 5 mTOR pathway genes (TSC1, TSC2, MTOR, PTEN, PIK3CA) and 6 genes commonly mutated in RCC (BAP1, KDM5C, PBRM1 SETD2, TP53, and VHL). Among the 109 patients, 93 (85%) patients had clear cell histology, and 31 (28%) showed CB. Nine of 30 (30%) patients harboring mTOR pathway mutations in their tumor achieved CB versus 22 of 79 (28%) in the wild-type group. There was no distinct association between any individual or combination of mTOR pathway gene mutations and CB. Three of 7 patients with TSC1 mutations showed CB. In addition, none of the 6 genes commonly mutated in RCC showed a mutation pattern that correlated with CB. Overall, in this large and diverse population of patients with mRCC, there is no suggestion of a correlation between response to rapalog therapy and mutation status for mTOR pathway genes.",

Both TSC1 and TSC2 are involved in several protein-protein interactions, which play a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The recent biochemical, genetic, structural biology, clinical and drug discovery advancements on TSC give a useful insight into the disease as well as the molecular aspects of TSC1 and TSC2. The complex nature of TSC disease, a wide range of manifestations, mosaicism and several other factors limits the treatment choices. This review is a compilation of the course of TSC, starting from its discovery to the current findings that would take us a step ahead in finding a cure for TSC.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Following the identification of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, a link to regulatory control of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has paved the way for new therapeutic interventions, and now even approved therapies for TSC. Gene identification has permitted establishment of cell lines and conditional knockout mouse strains to assay how abnormalities in brain structure lead to enhanced excitability, seizures, cognitive disabilities, and other neuropsychological disorders in TSC. Furthermore, work in in vitro systems and analysis of rodent models and human tissue has allowed investigators to study how brain lesions form in TSC. Evolving questions over the next decade include understanding the high clinical variability of TSC, defining why there is a lack of clear genotype-phenotype correlations, and identifying biomarkers for prognosis and stratification. The study of TSC has in many ways reflected a paradigm \"bench-to-bedside\" success story that serves as a model of many other neurological disorders.",

    "pages": "3045-57",
    "abstract": "The serine/threonine kinase mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates various environmental cues such as the presence of antigen, inflammation, and nutrients to regulate T cell growth, metabolism, and function. The tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 complex negatively regulates the activity of an mTOR-containing multiprotein complex called mTOR complex 1. Recent studies have revealed an essential cell-intrinsic role for TSC1 in T cell survival, quiescence, and mitochondrial homeostasis. Given the emerging role of mTOR activity in the regulation of the quantity and quality of CD8 T cell responses, in this study, we examine the role of its suppressor, TSC1, in the regulation of antigen-specific primary and memory CD8 T cell responses to bacterial infection. Using an established model system of transgenic CD8 cell adoptive transfer and challenge with Listeria monocytogenes expressing a cognate antigen, we found that TSC1 deficiency impairs antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses, resulting in weak expansion, exaggerated contraction, and poor memory generation. Poor expansion of TSC1-deficient cells was associated with defects in survival and proliferation in vivo, while enhanced contraction was correlated with an increased ratio of short-lived effectors to memory precursors in the effector cell population. This perturbation of effector-memory differentiation was concomitant with decreased expression of eomesodermin among activated TSC1 knockout cells. Upon competitive adoptive transfer with wild-type counterparts and antigen rechallenge, TSC1-deficient memory cells showed moderate defects in expansion but not cytokine production. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence of a CD8 T cell-intrinsic role for TSC1 in the regulation of antigen-specific primary and memory responses.",

    "issue": "12(3)",
    "pages": "294-301",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are autosomal-dominant genetic disorders that result from dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17q11.2. Its protein product, neurofibromin, functions as a tumor suppressor and ultimately produces constitutive upregulation of mTOR. TSC is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (chromosome 9q34) or TSC2 (chromosome 16p.13.3) genes. Their protein products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a dimer that acts via the GAP protein Rheb (Ras homolog enhanced in brain) to directly inhibit mTOR, again resulting in upregulation. Specific inhibitors of mTOR are in clinical use, including sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus, and deforolimus. Everolimus has been shown to reduce the volume and appearance of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA), facial angiofibromas, and renal angiomyolipomas associated with TSC, with a recent FDA approval for SEGA not suitable for surgical resection. This article reviews the use of mTOR inhibitors in these diseases, which have the potential to be a disease-modifying therapy in these and other conditions.",

    "abstract": "Terminal maturation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells from stage 2 (CD44+NK1.1-) to stage 3 (CD44+NK1.1+) is accompanied by a functional acquisition of a predominant IFN-γ-producing (iNKT-1) phenotype; however, some cells develop into IL-17-producing iNKT (iNKT-17) cells. iNKT-17 cells are rare and restricted to a CD44+NK1.1- lineage. It is unclear how iNKT terminal maturation is regulated and what factors mediate the predominance of iNKT-1 compared with iNKT-17. The tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) is an important negative regulator of mTOR signaling, which regulates T cell differentiation, function, and trafficking. Here, we determined that mice lacking TSC1 exhibit a developmental block of iNKT differentiation at stage 2 and skew from a predominantly iNKT-1 population toward a predominantly iNKT-17 population, leading to enhanced airway hypersensitivity. Evaluation of purified iNKT cells revealed that TSC1 promotes T-bet, which regulates iNKT maturation, but downregulates ICOS expression in iNKT cells by inhibiting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, mice lacking T-bet exhibited both a terminal maturation defect of iNKT cells and a predominance of iNKT-17 cells, and increased ICOS expression was required for the predominance of iNKT-17 cells in the population of TSC1-deficient iNKT cells. Our data indicate that TSC1-dependent control of mTORC1 is crucial for terminal iNKT maturation and effector lineage decisions, resulting in the predominance of iNKT-1 cells.",

The identification of TSC1 and TSC2, as tumor suppressor genes causative of the disorder, led to the elucidation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hamartoma formation. This knowledge was translated into standard clinical practice with the discovery of rapamycin, and additional analogues, as inhibitors of mTORC1.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNext-generation sequencing was proven to be fundamental to drive research of tumorigenesis in TSC, hopefully leading to new therapeutic options in the future.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a model disorder for understanding brain development because the genes that cause TSC are known, many downstream molecular pathways have been identified, and the resulting perturbations of cellular events are established. TSC, therefore, provides an intellectual framework to understand the molecular and biochemical pathways that orchestrate normal brain development. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode Hamartin and Tuberin which form a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex. Inactivating mutations in TSC genes (TSC1/TSC2) cause sustained Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) activation of the mammalian isoform of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). TOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell size in many organisms throughout nature. mTORC1 inhibits catabolic processes including autophagy and activates anabolic processes including mRNA translation. mTORC1 regulation is achieved through two main upstream mechanisms. The first mechanism is regulation by growth factor signaling. The second mechanism is regulation by amino acids. Gene mutations that cause too much or too little mTORC1 activity lead to a spectrum of neuroanatomical changes ranging from altered brain size (micro and macrocephaly) to cortical malformations to Type I neoplasias. Because somatic mutations often underlie these changes, the timing, and location of mutation results in focal brain malformations. These mutations, therefore, provide gain-of-function and loss-of-function changes that are a powerful tool to assess the events that have gone awry during development and to determine their functional physiological consequences. Knowledge about the TSC-mTORC1 pathway has allowed scientists to predict which upstream and downstream mutations should cause commensurate neuroanatomical changes. Indeed, many of these predictions have now been clinically validated. A description of clinical imaging and histochemical findings is provided in relation to laboratory models of TSC that will allow the reader to appreciate how human pathology can provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of development.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease of women, is associated with cystic lung destruction resulting from the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like LAM cells with mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes TSC1 and/or TSC2 The mutant genes and encoded proteins are responsible for activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is inhibited by sirolimus (rapamycin), a drug used to treat LAM. Patients who have LAM may also be treated with bronchodilators for asthma-like symptoms due to LAM. We observed stabilization of forced expiratory volume in 1 s over time in patients receiving sirolimus and long-acting beta-agonists with short-acting rescue inhalers compared with patients receiving only sirolimus. Because beta-agonists increase cAMP and PKA activity, we investigated effects of PKA activation on the mTOR pathway. Human skin TSC2+/- fibroblasts or LAM lung cells incubated short-term with isoproterenol (beta-agonist) showed a sirolimus-independent increase in phosphorylation of S6, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, and increased cell growth. Cells incubated long-term with isoproterenol, which may lead to beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, did not show increased S6 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKA blocked the isoproterenol effect on S6 phosphorylation. Thus, activation of PKA by beta-agonists increased phospho-S6 independent of mTOR, an effect abrogated by beta-agonist-driven receptor desensitization. In agreement, retrospective clinical data from patients with LAM suggested that a combination of bronchodilators in conjunction with sirolimus may be preferable to sirolimus alone for stabilization of pulmonary function.",

    "issue": "34(2)",
    "pages": "551-61",
    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is highly resistant to current chemotherapy regimens. Novel therapeutic approaches, potentially involving targeting of specific survival pathways, are needed. We used 17-AAG to inhibit Hsp90 and rapamycin to inhibit mTOR, in the osteosarcoma cell lines, HOS and KHOS/NP. HOS and KHOS cells were treated for 24 and 48 h with 17-AAG or rapamycin and studied drug-induced apoptosis, cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), dephosphorylation of signal transduction proteins in the Akt/MAP kinase pathway and mTOR signaling. 17-AAG was a potent inducer of apoptosis, involving effective depletion of GSH and mitochondrial membrane (MM) depolarization, strong activation of caspase-8 and -9 and release of AIF from mitochondria to the cytosol. Furthermore, 17-AAG down-regulated pAkt, p44Erk, p-mTOR, p70S6, TSC1/2 and pGSK-3beta. Treatment with 17-AAG also caused down-regulation of cyclin D1, GADD45a, GADD34 and pCdc2 and upregulation of cyclin B1 and mitotic block. A decrease in Hsp90 and increase in Hsp70 and Hsp70 C-terminal fragments were also observed. Rapamycin was a less potent inducer of apoptosis, involving a small decrease in GSH and MM potential with no activation of caspases or release of AIF. Rapamycin strongly inhibited cell growth with an increase in G1 and a decrease in S-phase of the cell cycle concomitant with down-regulation of cyclin D1. Rapamycin also down-regulated the activity of p70S6, pAkt and p-mTOR, but had no effect on pGSK-3beta, p44Erk, pCdc2, TSC1/2 or Hsp70 or Hsp90. We conclude that Hsp90 inhibition merits further study in the therapy of osteosarcoma.",

    "title": "New strategy for in vitro activation of primordial follicles with mTOR and PI3K stimulators.",
    "issue": "14(5)",
    "pages": "721-31",
    "abstract": "It had been known for decades that primordial follicles in mammalian ovaries are assembled with definite numbers and represent the ovarian reserve throughout the reproductive life. Intra-oocyte PI3K/mTOR pathways have been indicated to play a central role on the activation of primordial follicles. Genetic modified mouse models with chronic activation of PI3K/mTOR signals in primordial oocytes showed premature activation of all primordial follicles and eventually their exhaustion. On the other hand, this may suggest that, unlike chronic activation of PI3K/mTOR, its acute activation in infertility would activate primordial follicles, permitting fertility during the treatment. Previously, PI3K stimulators were reported as a temporary measure to accelerate primordial follicle activation and follicular development in both mouse and human, and were applied in the treatment of infertility in premature ovarian failure (POF) patients. To address whether mTOR stimulators could play similar role in the process, we transiently treated neonatal and aged mouse ovaries with mTOR stimulators-phosphatidic acid (PA) and propranolol. Our results demonstrated the stimulators increased activation of primordial follicles and the production of progeny. Human ovarian cortex cubes were also treated with mTOR or/and PI3K stimulators in vitro. When they were used separately, both of them showed similar promotive effects on primordial follicles. Surprisingly, after joint-treatment with the 2 kinds of stimulators together, synergistic effects on follicular development were observed. Based on increased efficiency of follicular activation in humans, here we propose in vitro transient treatment with mTOR and PI3K stimulators as an optimized protocol for the application in different clinical conditions with limited follicle reserve.",

    "abstract": "Memory CD8(+) T cells are an essential component of protective immunity. Signaling via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been implicated in the regulation of the differentiation of effector and memory T cells. However, little is understood about the mechanisms that control mTOR activity, or the effector pathways regulated by mTOR. We describe here that tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1), a regulator of mTOR signaling, plays a crucial role in promoting the differentiation and function of memory CD8(+) T cells in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Mice with specific deletion of Tsc1 in antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells evoked normal effector responses, but were markedly impaired in the generation of memory T cells and their recall responses to antigen reexposure in a cell-intrinsic manner. Tsc1 deficiency suppressed the generation of memory-precursor effector cells while promoting short-lived effector cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Tsc1 coordinated gene expression programs underlying immune function, transcriptional regulation, and cell metabolism. Furthermore, Tsc1 deletion led to excessive mTORC1 activity and dysregulated glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in response to IL-15 stimulation. These findings establish a Tsc1-mediated checkpoint in linking immune signaling and cell metabolism to orchestrate memory CD8(+) T-cell development and function.",

    "issue": "52()",
    "pages": "12-20",
    "abstract": "Understanding the development and function of the nervous system is one of the foremost aims of current biomedical research. The nervous system is generated during a relatively short period of intense neurogenesis that is orchestrated by a number of key molecular signalling pathways. Even subtle defects in the activity of these molecules can have serious repercussions resulting in neurological, neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive problems including epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a monogenic disease characterised by these problems and by the formation of benign tumours in multiple organs, including the brain. TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene leading to activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. A desire to understand the neurological manifestations of TSC has stimulated research into the role of the mTOR pathway in neurogenesis. In this review we describe TSC neurobiology and how the use of animal model systems has provided insights into the roles of mTOR signalling in neuronal differentiation and migration. Recent progress in this field has identified novel mTOR pathway components regulating neuronal differentiation. The roles of mTOR signalling and aberrant neurogenesis in epilepsy are also discussed. Continuing efforts to understand mTOR neurobiology will help to identify new therapeutic targets for TSC and other neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Failure in the regulation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to be critical to the pathogenesis of the inherited disorder tuberous sclerosis and the related lung disease LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis). Both diseases are caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 (TSC is tuberous sclerosis complex) that impair GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex for Rheb, leading to inappropriate activity of signalling downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1). mTOR inhibitors are already used in a variety of clinical settings including as immunosuppressants, anticancer agents and antiproliferative agents in drug-eluting coronary artery stents. They also represent candidate therapies directed to the underlying molecular pathology in tuberous sclerosis and LAM. Phase I/II clinical trials of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin have demonstrated reduction in size of tuberous-sclerosis- and LAM-associated renal tumours (angiomyolipomas) and some evidence for reversible improvement in lung function in patients with LAM. A case series of tuberous-sclerosis-associated brain tumours were also reported to shrink during rapamycin therapy. An important, although variable, feature of the tuberous sclerosis phenotype is learning difficulty. Recent studies in mouse models carrying heterozygous Tsc2 mutations demonstrated improvement in memory and learning deficits following treatment with rapamycin. These promising pre-clinical and early human trials are being followed by larger-scale randomized control trials of mTOR inhibitors for treatment of renal, lung and brain manifestations of TSC1- and TSC2-associated disease.",

    "pages": "4104-15",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that forms two functionally distinct complexes important for nutrient and growth factor signaling. Both complexes phosphorylate a hydrophobic motif on downstream protein kinases, which contributes to the activation of these kinases. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) phosphorylates S6K1, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt. The TSC1-TSC2 complex is a critical negative regulator of mTORC1. However, how mTORC2 is regulated and whether the TSC1-TSC2 complex is involved are unknown. We find that mTORC2 isolated from a variety of cells lacking a functional TSC1-TSC2 complex is impaired in its kinase activity toward Akt. Importantly, the defect in mTORC2 activity in these cells can be separated from effects on mTORC1 signaling and known feedback mechanisms affecting insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Our data also suggest that the TSC1-TSC2 complex positively regulates mTORC2 in a manner independent of its GTPase-activating protein activity toward Rheb. Finally, we find that the TSC1-TSC2 complex can physically associate with mTORC2 but not mTORC1. These data demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2 complex inhibits mTORC1 and activates mTORC2, which through different mechanisms promotes Akt activation.",

TSC1 and TSC2 function as a heterodimer to inhibit cell growth and proliferation. Another protein, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), is regarded as a central controller of cell growth in response to growth factors, cellular energy and nutrient levels. Recent breakthroughs in TSC research link the TSC1/2 heterodimer protein to the mTOR signaling network. It has recently been shown that TSC2 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity towards the Ras family small GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), and TSC1/2 antagonizes the mTOR signaling pathway via stimulation of GTP hydrolysis of Rheb. Thus, TSC1/2 and Rheb have pivotal roles in mediating growth factors, nutrient and energy sensing signals to mTOR-dependent targets. These discoveries lend new insight into TSC pathogenesis.",

    "issue": "2(11)",
    "pages": "1051-60",
    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutation in either of 2 tumor suppressor genes, TSC-1 (encodes hamartin) and TSC-2 (encodes tuberin). In humans, deficiency in TSC1/2 is associated with benign tumors in many organs, including renal angiomyolipoma (AML) but rarely renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In contrast, deficiency of TSC function in the Eker rat is associated with RCC. Here, we have investigated the activity of PI 3-K and the expression of PTEN, p53, tuberin, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K in both Eker rat RCC and human renal AML. Compared to normal tissue, increased PI 3-K activity was detected in RCC of Eker rats but not in human AML tissue. In contrast, PTEN was highly expressed in AML but significantly reduced in the renal tumors of Eker rats. Phosphorylation on Ser(2448) of mTOR and Thr(389) of p70S6K were significantly increased in both RCC and AML compared to matching control tissue. Total tuberin was significantly decreased in AML while completely lost in RCC of Eker rats. Our data also show that while p53 protein expression is lost in rat RCC, it was highly elevated in AML. These novel data provide evidence that loss of TSC-2, PTEN, and p53 as well as activation of PI 3-K and mTOR is associated with kidney cancer in the Eker rat, while sustained expression of TSC-2, PTEN, and p53 may prevent progression of kidney cancer in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Miscoordination of growth and proliferation with the cellular stress response can lead to tumorigenesis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central cell growth controller, is highly activated in some malignant neoplasms, and its clinical implications are under extensive investigation. We show that constitutive mTOR activity amplifies p53 activation, in vitro and in vivo, by stimulating p53 translation. Thus, loss of TSC1 or TSC2, the negative regulators of mTOR, results in dramatic accumulation of p53 and apoptosis in response to stress conditions. In other words, the inactivation of mTOR prevents cell death by nutrient stress and genomic damage via p53. Consistently, we also show that p53 is elevated in TSC tumors, which rarely become malignant. The coordinated relationship between mTOR and p53 during cellular stress provides a possible explanation for the benign nature of hamartoma syndromes, including TSC. Clinically, this also suggests that the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in anti-neoplastic therapy may also depend on p53 status, and mTOR inhibitors may antagonize the effects of genotoxic chemotherapeutics.",

The mechanisms underlying TSC cystic kidney disease remain unclear, with no available interventions to prevent cyst formation. Using targeted deletion of TSC1 in nephron progenitor cells, we showed that cysts in TSC1-null embryonic kidneys originate from injured proximal tubular cells with high mTOR complex 1 activity. Injection of rapamycin to pregnant mice inhibited the mTOR pathway and tubular cell proliferation in kidneys of TSC1-null offspring. Rapamycin also prevented renal cystogenesis and prolonged the life span of TSC newborns. Gene expression analysis of proximal tubule cells identified sets of genes and pathways that were modified secondary to TSC1 deletion and rescued by rapamycin administration during nephrogenesis. Inflammation with mononuclear infiltration was observed in the cystic areas of TSC1-null kidneys. Dexamethasone administration during pregnancy decreased cyst formation by not only inhibiting the inflammatory response, but also interfering with the mTORC1 pathway. These results reveal mechanisms of cystogenesis in TSC disease and suggest interventions before birth to ameliorate cystic disease in offspring.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAltered cellular metabolism is considered to be one of the hallmarks of cancer (Coller, Am J Pathol 184:4-17, 2014; Kim and Bae, Curr Opin Hematol 25:52-59, 2018). However, few studies have investigated the role of metabolism in the development of gastric precancerous lesions (GPLs). Weipiling (WPL), a traditional Chinese medicine formula for treatment of GPLs. In this study, we evaluated the amelioration of GPLs by WPL and investigated the possible role of WPL in regulating glucose metabolism.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFirstly, the major components of WPL are chemically characterized by HPLC analytical method. In this study, we chose the Atp4a-/- mouse model (Spicer etal., J Biol Chem 275:21555-21565, 2000) for GPL analysis. Different doses of WPL were administered orally to mice for 10 weeks. Next, the pathological changes of gastric mucosa were assessed by the H&E staining and AB-PAS staining. In addition, TUNEL staining was used to evaluate apoptosis, and we further used immunohistochemically labelled CDX2, MUC2, ki-67, PTEN, and p53 proteins to assess the characteristic changes of gastric mucosa in precancerous lesions. The levels of such transporters as HK-II, PKM2, ENO1, MPC1, and LDHA were determined by Western blot analysis. Finally, we assessed the expression of mTOR, HIF-1α, AMPK, Rheb, TSC1 and TSC2 protein in the gastric mucosa of Atp4a-/-mice.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this work, we evaluated the protective effect of WPL on gastric mucosa in mice with precancerous lesions. The aberrant apoptosis in gastric mucosa of gastric pre-cancerous lesions was controlled by WPL (P<0.05). Furthermore, WPL suppressed the expression of CDX2, MUC2, ki-67, PTEN and p53, as the levels of these proteins decreased significantly compared with the model group (P<0.05). In parallel, WPL significantly suppressed the expression of transporters, such as HK-II, PKM2, ENO1, MPC1 and LDHA (P<0.05). In addition, mTOR, HIF-1a, AMPK, Rheb, TSC1 and TSC2 protein levels in gastric mucosa of Atp4a-/- mice in the high- and low-dose WPL groups were significantly lower than those in the model group (P<0.05), while the expression of TSC1 and TSC2 protein was significantly higher (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConclusively, WPL could ameliorate GPLs in Atp4a-/- mice by inhibiting the expression of transporters and suppressing the aberrant activation of mTOR/HIF-1α.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease related to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and manifested by neurological symptoms, such as epilepsy and sleep disorders. The pathophysiology of sleep dysfunction is poorly understood and is likely multifactorial, but may involve intrinsic biological regulators in the brain. Here, we characterized a mouse model of sleep disorders in TSC and investigated mechanisms of sleep dysfunction in this conditional knockout model involving inactivation of the Tsc1 gene in neurons and astrocytes (Tsc1GFAPCKO mice). Sleep studies utilizing EEG, EMG, and behavioral analysis found that Tsc1GFAPCKO mice have decreased REM sleep and impaired sleep-wake differentiation between light and dark phases. mTOR activity and orexin expression were increased in hypothalamic sections and cultured hypothalamic neurons from Tsc1GFAPCKO mice. Both the sleep abnormalities and increased orexin expression in Tsc1GFAPCKO mice were reversed by rapamycin treatment, indicating their dependence on mTOR activation. An orexin antagonist, suvorexant, also restored normal REM levels in Tsc1GFAPCKO mice. These results identify a novel mechanistic link between mTOR and orexin in the hypothalamus related to sleep dysfunction and suggest a targeted therapeutic approach to sleep disorders in TSC.",

    "pages": "313",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates essential processes directed to preserve cellular homeostasis, such as cell growth, proliferation, survival, protein synthesis and autophagy. Importantly, mTOR pathway deregulation has been related to many diseases. Indeed, it has become a hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, since a fine-tuned regulation of mTOR activities is crucial for neuron function and survival. RTP801/REDD1/Dig2 has become one of the most puzzling regulators of mTOR. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, RTP801 inactivates mTOR and Akt via the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) in many cellular contexts. Intriguingly, RTP801 protects dividing cells from hypoxia or H2O2-induced apoptosis, while it sensitizes differentiated cells to stress. Based on experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), it has been proposed that at early stages of the disease, stress-induced RTP801 upregulation contributes to mTOR repression, in an attempt to maintain cell function and viability. However, if RTP801 elevation is sustained, it leads to neuron cell death by a sequential inhibition of mTOR and Akt. Here, we will review RTP801 deregulation of mTOR in a context of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study aimed to investigate the relationship between the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway-related genes-TSC1/2.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 46 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC and performed next generation sequencing to analyze the relationship between the efficacy of sirolimus after liver transplantation for HCC and mutations in mTOR pathway-related genes, especially tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average age of 46 patients with liver transplantation for HCC was 51±21 years. After surgery, 35 patients received an anti-rejection/anti-tumor regimen that included sirolimus, and 11 patients did not receive sirolimus. There was no significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P=0.761). The gene sequencing results showed mTOR-related pathway mutations in 10 patients, of whom five (10.9%) had TSC1/2 mutations. Of the 35 patients using sirolimus, those with mTOR-related mutations had significantly better survival rates than patients without mTOR-related mutations (P=0.016).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to genetic sequencing results, a personalized treatment plan for specific genetic mutations should be selected in patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. Patients with mTOR-related gene mutations, especially TSC mutations, can gain significant benefits from the use of mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus.",

    "pages": "443-67",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is an integral cell growth regulator. The mTOR pathway involves two functional complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, which have been defined by both their association with raptor or rictor, respectively, and their sensitivity to short-term rapamycin inhibition. Loss of tumor suppressors TSC1 or TSC2 leads to aberrant activation of TORC1, which has been implicated in the control of cell size. As a result, both physiologic and pathologic tissue hypertrophy are associated with TORC1 activation. Some clinical examples include skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy, vascular restenosis, and compensatory nephrotic hypertrophy. Clarification of the mTOR pathway may lead to increased understanding of both the etiology and consequences of aberrant cell size regulation. This review covers some of the biochemical regulation of the mTOR pathway that may be important to the regulation of cell size, and it will present several potential clinical applications where the control of cell size may be biologically significant.",

    "issue": "3()",
    "pages": "85",
    "abstract": "The PI3K-Akt pathway together with one of its downstream targets, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as the mammalian target of rapamycin) is a highly deregulated pathway in cancers. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Akt phosphorylated at T308 inhibits TSC1/2 complex to activate mTORC1; mTORC2 is recognized as the kinase phosphorylating Akt at S473. Inhibition of autophagy by mTORC1 was shown to rescue disheveled (Dvl) leading to activation of Wnt pathway. Cyclin D1 and the c-Myc are activated by the Wnt signaling. Cyclin D1 is a key player in initiation of cell cycle. c-Myc triggers metabolic reprograming in G1 phase of cell cycle, which also activates the transcription factors like FoxO and p53 that play key roles in promoting the progression of cell cycle. While the role of p53 in cancer cell metabolism in arresting glycolysis and inhibition of pentose phosphate pathway has come to be recognized, there are confusions in the literature on the role of FoxO and that of rictor. FoxO was shown to be the transcription factor of rictor, in addition to the cell cycle inhibitors like p21. Rictor has dual roles; inhibition of c-Myc and constitution of mTORC2, both of which are key factors in the exit of G1-S phase and entry into G2 phase of cell cycle. A model is presented in this article, which suggests that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Wnt pathways converge and regulate the progression of cell cycle through G0-G1-S-phases and reprogram the metabolism in cancer cells. This model is different from the conventional method of looking at individual pathways triggering the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is a disease caused by mutations in two tumor-suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2. The TSC1 protein, also known as hamartin, has a critical role in controlling mTOR signalling. TSC1 does not bear apparent sequence homology with other proteins. Here we show that the N-terminal half of yeast TSC1 forms a protease-resistant domain, which is evolutionarily conserved. The crystal structure of this yeast TSC1 core domain shows that it contains a pseudo-HEAT repeat fold with its C-terminal end capped by a helical subdomain. This allows us to model the three-dimensional structure of the human TSC1 N-terminal domain (TSC1-NTD), which anchors essentially all pathogenic TSC1 missense mutations found in tuberous sclerosis patients. Interestingly, most pathogenic mutations map inside of the folded TSC1-NTD structure, whereas most non-pathogenic variants are on the structural surface. This indicates that the disruption of the TSC1-NTD globular structure is a major cause of tuberous sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The most exciting advances in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) field occurred in 1993 and 1997 with the cloning of the TSC2 and TSC1 genes, respectively, and in 2003 with the identification of Rheb as the target of tuberin's (TSC2) GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. Rheb has a dual role: it activates mTOR and inactivates B-Raf. Activation of mTOR leads to increased protein synthesis through phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1. Upon insulin or growth factor stimulation, tuberin is phosphorylated by several kinases, including AKT/PKB, thereby suppressing its GAP activity and activating mTOR. Phosphorylation of hamartin (TSC1) by CDK1 also negatively regulates the activity of the hamartin/tuberin complex. Despite these biochemical advances, exactly how mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 lead to the clinical manifestations of TSC is far from being understood. Two of the most unusual phenotypes in TSC are the apparent metastasis of benign cells carrying TSC1 and TSC2 mutations, resulting in pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis, and the ability of cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations to differentiate into the separate components of renal angiomyolipomas (vessels, smooth muscle and fat). We will discuss how the TSC signaling pathways are affected by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, focusing on how these mutations may lead to the renal and pulmonary manifestations of TSC.",

    "pages": "1361-71",
    "abstract": "Angiomyolipoma (AML) belong to a family of tumors known as perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) that share a common immunophenotypic profile of muscle and melanocytic differentiation. These tumors are clonal in nature and have a strong association with tuberous sclerosis. Genetic analyses have reported allelic imbalance at the TSC2 locus on 16p13. In the context of non-tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), non-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated AMLs, and non-renal PEComas, the functional status of the TSC2 signaling pathway has not been reported. Studies over the last several years have uncovered a critical role of the TSC1/2 genes in negatively regulating the Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K cascade. Here, we examined the activity of this pathway in sporadic AMLs and PEComas using immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses. We found increased levels of phospho-p70S6K, a marker of mTOR activity, in 15 of 15 non-TSC AMLs. This was accompanied by reduced phospho-AKT expression, a pattern that is consistent with the disruption of TSC1/2 function. Western blot analysis confirmed mTOR activation concurrent with the loss of TSC2 and not TSC1 in sporadic AMLs. Similarly, elevated phospho-p70S6K and reduced phospho-AKT expression was detected in 14 of 15 cases of extrarenal PEComas. These observations provide the first functional evidence that mTOR activation is common to sporadic, non-TSC-related AMLs and PEComas. This suggests the possibility that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin may be therapeutic for this class of disease.",

Epilepsy is the most common disorder in TSC, frequently associated with intractable and early onset seizures, and often as infantile spasms.

TBC1D7 is the third subunit of the TSC complex, and helps to stabilize the TSC1-TSC2 complex through its direct interaction with TSC1. Homozygous inactivation of TBC1D7 causes intellectual disability and megaencephaly. Here we report the crystal structure of a TSC1-TBC1D7 complex and biochemical characterization of the TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction. TBC1D7 interacts with the C-terminal region of the predicted coiled-coil domain of TSC1. The TSC1-TBC1D7 interface is largely hydrophobic, involving the α4 helix of TBC1D7. Each TBC1D7 molecule interacts simultaneously with two parallel TSC1 helices from two TSC1 molecules, suggesting that TBC1D7 may stabilize the TSC complex by tethering the C-terminal ends of two TSC1 coiled-coils.",

Abnormal activation of mTOR uncouples anabolic cell growth processes such as protein and lipid synthesis from external growth factor or nutrient cues. However, abnormal activation of mTOR upon loss of TSC1/TSC2 complex function is now known to lead to compensatory mechanisms that restrict the development of malignant tumors. The rare occurrence of complete loss of TSC1/TSC2 function in human tumors suggests that retaining growth suppressor activity might be beneficial during tumour evolution, perhaps by promoting survival when cells grow in a nutrient-limited environment.",

    "abstract": "The AKT/TSC/mTOR axis is an important pathway controlling cell growth, survival, and proliferation in response to extracellular cues. Recently, it was reported that AKT activity fluctuates across the cell cycle. However, it remains unclear whether downstream targets of AKT are also regulated by the cell cycle. Here, we report that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with AKT activity during the cell cycle. Mechanistically, Plk1 phosphorylation of TSC1 at S467 and S578 interfered with TSC1/TSC2 binding, destabilized TSC1, promoted dissociation of the TSC complex from the lysosome, and eventually led to mTORC1 activation. Tumors derived from cancer cells expressing the TSC1-S467E/S578E mutant exhibited greater sensitivity to rapamycin than those expressing WT TSC1. Collectively, our data support a model in which Plk1, instead of AKT, regulates the TSC/mTORC1 pathway during mitosis, eventually regulating the efficacy of rapamycin.Significance: This seminal report shows that activation of mTORC1 can be independent of AKT during mitosis.

    "abstract": "Tumour suppressors hamartin and tuberin, encoded by tuberous sclerosis complex 1(TSC1) and TSC2 genes, respectively, are critical regulators of cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes are the cause of an autosomal dominant disorder known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Another genetic disorder, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), is also associated with mutations in the TSC2 gene. Hamartin and tuberin control cell growth by negatively regulating S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), potentially through their upstream modulator mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Growth factors and insulin promote Akt/PKB-dependent phosphorylation of tuberin, which in turn, releases S6K1 from negative regulation by tuberin and results in the activation of S6K1. Although much has been written regarding the molecular genetics of TSC and LAM, which is associated with either the loss of or mutation in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, few reviews have addressed the intracellular signalling pathways regulated by hamartin and tuberin. The current review will fill the gap in our understanding of their role in cellular signalling networks, and by improving this understanding, an integrated picture regarding the normal function of tuberin and hamartin is beginning to emerge.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S), an important E2 enzyme in the process of ubiquitination, has exhibited oncogenic activities in various malignant tumors. However, it remains unknown whether UBE2S plays a role in urinary bladder cancer (UBC) development. In the current study, our data confirmed UBE2S upregulation in UBC. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that UBE2S knockdown resulted in attenuated proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, which was inverse to the phenotypes with UBE2S overexpression. Gain and loss of function assays confirmed that UBE2S exerts oncogenic activities in UBC by mediating the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Furthermore, we discovered that this UBE2S-modulated carcinogenic mechanism was in the consequence of directly targeting tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), which is the upstream inhibitor of mTOR signaling for ubiquitous degradation. Taken together, this study demonstrated that UBE2S is a carcinogen in UBC and promotes UBC progression by ubiquitously degrading TSC1. This consequently mediates the activation of the mTOR pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic regimen for UBC by targeting the newly identified UBE2S/TSC1/mTOR axis.",

    "issue": "59(2)",
    "pages": "276-83",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder promoting the development of benign tumors in multiple organ systems, including the skin, brain, and kidneys. In contrast to asymptomatic spontaneous angiomyolipomas, angiomyolipomas in patients with TSC are mostly bilateral and are accompanied by other typical clinical features of TSC. Kidney angiomyolipomas are benign tumors composed of blood vessels, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle and are associated with spontaneous bleeding and potential life-threatening hemorrhage if >4 cm. Current treatment options for angiomyolipoma are focused on conserving kidney function and limiting potentially fatal hemorrhage. TSC is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 suppressor genes, resulting in increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Preclinical studies have shown the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in inhibiting the growth of patient-derived cell lines and suppressing tumors in animal models of TSC. In the clinical setting, mTOR inhibitors have shown promising efficacy in patients with TSC-associated angiomyolipomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. This review explores the diagnosis and current management of TSC-associated angiomyolipomas, the relevance of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis of TSC, and the potential promise of mTOR-inhibitor therapy as a systemic therapeutic approach to treat the underlying cause of TSC.",

    "issue": "67(4)",
    "pages": "1609-17",
    "abstract": "Nucleophosmin (B23) is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that has been implicated in numerous cellular processes. In particular, nucleophosmin interacts with nucleolar components of newly synthesized ribosomes to promote ribosome nuclear export. Nucleophosmin is a classic mitogen-induced protein, with changes in its expression correlating with growth factor stimulation. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism of nucleophosmin induction and showed that hyperproliferative signals emanating from oncogenic H-Ras(V12) cause tremendous increases in nucleophosmin protein expression. Nucleophosmin protein accumulation was dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, as rapamycin completely prevented nucleophosmin induction. Consistent with this finding, genetic ablation of Tsc1, a major upstream inhibitor of mTOR, resulted in nucleophosmin protein induction through increased translation of existing nucleophosmin mRNAs. Increases in nucleophosmin protein accumulation were suppressed by reintroduction of TSC1. Induction of nucleophosmin through Tsc1 loss resulted in a greater pool of actively translating ribosomes in the cytoplasm, higher overall rates of protein synthesis, and increased cell proliferation, all of which were dependent on efficient nucleophosmin nuclear export. Nucleophosmin protein accumulation in the absence of Tsc1 promoted the nuclear export of maturing ribosome subunits, providing a mechanistic link between TSC1/mTOR signaling, nucleophosmin-mediated nuclear export of ribosome subunits, protein synthesis levels, and cell growth.",

    "issue": "525()",
    "pages": "33-45",
    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be closely related to cancer progression and therapy. However, the clinical significance of lncRNAs and the mechanisms by which they function in glioma are largely unknown. In this study, using online data sets combined with collected clinical glioma tissues, we determined that the lncRNA KB-1460A1.5 is downregulated and positively correlated with prognosis in glioma. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of KB-1460A1.5 inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while downregulation of KB-1460A1.5 has the opposite effects. Mechanistically, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that KB-1460A1.5 preferentially affects the Akt/TSC1/mTOR pathway. KB-1460A1.5 was found to function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of TSC1, a key regulatory component of the mTOR pathway, by sponging miR-130a-3p in glioma cells. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the mTOR pathway regulates the expression of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which in turn binds directly to the KB-1460A1.5 promoter and affects the expression of KB-1460A1.5. Untargeted metabolomics and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis further confirmed the effects of KB-1460A1.5 on amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, this study revealed that lncRNA KB-1460A1.5 inhibits glioma tumorigenesis via miR-130a-3p/TSC1/mTOR/YY1 feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nMalignant PEComa are rare mesenchymal tumors characterized by genetic alterations actionable by target therapy. Indeed, they harbour loss of function of TSC1/TSC2, which lead to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is targetable therapeutically with mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus. A small subset of malignant PEComas instead harbor TFE3 gene fusions known to be mutually exclusive with TSC1/TSC2 loss-of-function mutations; therefore, leading to different therapeutic implication.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nmTOR inhibitors showed a response rate around 40% with a median PFS of 9 months both in retrospective case series than in phase 2 prospective clinical trials, therefore, representing the most active therapeutic drug. Up to now, the issue is the lack of further therapeutic lines in the advanced setting. Chemotherapy has a marginal role, while some responses were reported using Vascular endothelial growth factor-Tyrosine kynase inhibitors (VEGF-TKI) inhibitors.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nMalignant PEComas display some sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. If progression thereto, no other drugs are available. Preclinical studies are ongoing to explore the potential combination of hormonal blockade in women and the potential use of PD1 checkpoint inhibitors.",

Here, we propose that there are clinically relevant functions and targets of TSC1, TSC2 and Rheb, which are independent of mTOR.

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with variable phenotypic expression, due to a mutation in one of the two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, and a subsequent hyperactivation of the downstream mTOR pathway, resulting in increased cell growth and proliferation. The central nervous system is consistently involved in TSC, with 90% of individuals affected showing structural abnormalities, and almost all having some degree of CNS clinical manifestations, including seizures, cognitive impairment and behavioural problems. TSC is proving to be a particularly informative model for studying contemporary issues in developmental neurosciences. Recent advances in the neurobiology of TSC from molecular biology, molecular genetics, and animal model studies provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of TSC-related neurological symptoms. Rapamycin normalizes the dysregulated mTOR pathway, and recent clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in various TSC manifestations, suggesting the possibility that rapamycin may have benefit in the treatment of TSC brain disease.",

    "pages": "R251-8",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by benign tumors (hamartomas and hamartias) involving multiple organ systems, due to inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the growth and signaling functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 proteins. Led by seminal studies in Drosophila, the TSC1/TSC2 complex has been positioned in an ancestrally conserved signaling pathway that regulates cell growth. TSC1/TSC2 receives inputs from at least three major signaling pathways in the form of kinase-mediated phosphorylation events that regulate its function as a GTPase activating protein (GAP): the PI3K-Akt pathway, the ERK1/2-RSK1 pathway and the LKB1-AMPK pathway. TSC1/TSC2 functions as a GAP towards Rheb, which is a major regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the absence of either TSC1 or TSC2, high levels of Rheb-GTP lead to constitutive activation of mTOR-raptor signaling, thereby leading to enhanced and deregulated protein synthesis and cell growth. As a specific inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin has therapeutic potential for the treatment of TSC hamartomas.",

    "abstract": "RB1-inducible Coiled-Coil 1 (RB1CC1) has been shown to be a novel tumor suppressor regulating RB1 expression. Neuronal abundance of RB1CC1 is reported to contribute to the non-proliferating enlarged cell phenotype through the maintenance of RB1 and mTOR. To clarify whether RB1CC1 insufficiency is involved in neuronal atrophy and Alzheimer's pathology, we investigated modifications of RB1CC1 as a possible cause of atrophy or death through the disturbance of mTOR signaling in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. We also evaluated the correlation between RB1CC1 and mTOR signaling in a series of Alzheimer's brain tissues. Though RB1CC1 introduction enhanced neurite growth, RNAi-mediated knockdown of RB1CC1 or rapamycin treatment caused neurite atrophy and apoptosis due to mTOR signaling reduction in the differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Both TSC1 and RB1CC1 were equally functional and maintained mTOR signaling, indicated by phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) expression in 69% of Alzheimer's (9/13 cases) and 100% of normal brains (6/6 cases). However, scanty RB1CC1 expression, less than TSC1, caused phospho-S6 disappearance in 31% of Alzheimer's tissues (4/13 cases). These findings suggest that RB1CC1 insufficiency may result in mTOR signaling repression through unbalanced TSC1 abundance and may induce neuronal atrophy. These observations may have implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a key regulator of cellular metabolism. We used conditional deletion of Tsc1 to address how quiescence is associated with the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We demonstrate that Tsc1 deletion in the HSCs drives them from quiescence into rapid cycling, with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, this deletion dramatically reduced both hematopoiesis and self-renewal of HSCs, as revealed by serial and competitive bone marrow transplantation. In vivo treatment with an ROS antagonist restored HSC numbers and functions. These data demonstrated that the TSC-mTOR pathway maintains the quiescence and function of HSCs by repressing ROS production. The detrimental effect of up-regulated ROS in metabolically active HSCs may explain the well-documented association between quiescence and the \"stemness\" of HSCs.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway plays crucial roles in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the role of TSC1, a critical negative regulator of mTOR, in peripheral T cell homeostasis remains elusive. With T cell-specific Tsc1 conditional knockout (Tsc1 KO) mice, we found that peripheral naïve CD8(+) T cells but not CD4(+) T cells were severely reduced. Tsc1 KO naïve CD8(+) T cells showed profound survival defect in an adoptive transfer model and in culture with either stimulation of IL-7 or IL-15, despite comparable CD122 and CD127 expression between control and KO CD8(+) T cells. IL-7 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt(S473) was diminished in Tsc1 KO naïve CD8(+)T cells due to hyperactive mTOR-mediated feedback suppression on PI3K-AKT signaling. Furthermore, impaired Foxo1/Foxo3a phosphorylation and increased pro-apoptotic Bim expression in Tsc1 KO naïve CD8(+)T cells were observed upon stimulation of IL-7. Collectively, our study suggests that TSC1 plays an essential role in regulating peripheral naïve CD8(+) T cell homeostasis, possible via an mTOR-Akt-FoxO-Bim signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThis was a multicenter, histology-agnostic, single-arm prospective phase II trial of therapeutic activity of everolimus, an oral mTORC1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbored TSC1/TSC2 or MTOR mutations.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with tumors with inactivating TSC1/TSC2 or activating MTOR mutations identified in any Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory were eligible. Patients were treated with everolimus 10 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify co-occurring genomic alterations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween November 2015 and October 2018, 30 patients were enrolled at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Tumors harbored TSC1 (13/30), TSC2 (15/30), concurrent TSC1 and TSC2 (1/30), or MTOR (1/30) mutations. The most common treatment-related adverse event of any grade was mucositis (8/30, 27%); 1 patient had fatal pneumonitis. Partial responses were seen in 2 patients [7%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1%-22%]. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.7 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 7.3 months (95% CI, 4.5-12.7 months). There was no clear association between other genomic alterations and response. Of the 2 patients with objective response, 1 had upper tract urothelial carcinoma with biallelic inactivation of TSC1 and high tumor mutation burden, and the other had uterine carcinoma with biallelic TSC2-inactivating mutations and PEComa-like pathologic features.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEverolimus therapy had a disappointing ORR (7%) in this pan-cancer, mutation-selected, basket study.See related commentary by Kato and Cohen, p. 3807.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex proteins 1-2 (TSC1-TSC2) complex integrates both nutrient and hormonal signaling and is a critical negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. The use of different beta-cell lines expressing or not the insulin receptor (IR(+/+) and IR(-/-)) or with a reconstituted expression of IR isoform A or B (Rec A and Rec B) revealed that both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/TSC/mTOR complex 1 and MAPK kinase/ERK pathways mediate insulin signaling in IR(+/+)-, IRA-, or IRB-expressing cells. However, glucose signaling was mediated by MAPK kinase/ERK and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways as assessed in IR(-/-) cells. The effect of insulin on Akt phosphorylation was completely inhibited by the use of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin in IR(+/+) and Rec B cells, a partial inhibitory effect being observed in Rec A cell line. The knockdown of TSC2 expression up-regulated the downstream basal phosphorylation of 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and mTOR. More importantly, upregulation of p70S6K signaling impaired insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and p70S6K in IR(+/+) and Rec B but not in Rec A cell lines. In fact, insulin receptor substrate-1 Ser(307) phosphorylation signal in Rec B was stronger than in Rec A cell line during insulin action. Rec A cells induced a higher proliferation rate compared with Rec B or IR(+/+) during serum stimulation. Thus, we propose that the regulation of TSC2 phosphorylation by insulin or glucose independently integrates beta-cell proliferation signaling, the relative expression of IRA or IRB isoforms in pancreatic beta cells playing a major role.",

    "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase/PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (RTK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway is frequently altered in tumors. Inactivating mutations of either the TSC1 or the TSC2 tumor-suppressor genes cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a benign tumor syndrome in which there is both hyperactivation of mTOR and inhibition of RTK/PI3K/Akt signaling, partially due to reduced PDGFR expression. We report here that activation of PI3K or Akt, or deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) also suppresses PDGFR expression. This was a direct effect of mTOR activation, since rapamycin restored PDGFR expression and PDGF-sensitive Akt activation in Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- cells. Akt activation in response to EGF in Tsc2-/- cells was also reduced. Furthermore, Akt activation in response to each of EGF, IGF, and PMA was reduced in cells lacking both PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta, implying a role for PDGFR in transmission of growth signals downstream of these stimuli. Consistent with the reduction in PI3K/Akt signaling, in a nude mouse model both Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- cells had reduced tumorigenic potential in comparison to control cells, which was enhanced by expression of either active Akt or PDGFRbeta. In conclusion, PDGFR is a major target of negative feedback regulation in cells with activated mTOR, which limits the growth potential of TSC tumors.",

    "pages": "9399261",
    "abstract": "Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by the loss of ovarian function before 40 years of age and affects approximately 1% of women worldwide. Caragana sinica is a traditional Miao (a Chinese ethnic minority) medicine that improves ovarian function and follicular development. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of active ingredients of C. sinica on POI and determine underlying mechanisms. Herein, the chemical composition of the C. sinica compound was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, which identified hyperin (HR) as one of the main ingredients in C. sinica. Then, interaction targets of HR and POI were predicted and analyzed using network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The effect of HR on triptolide (TP)-induced granulosa cell injury was evaluated, and the underlying mechanism was explored based on bioinformatic results. A total of 100 interaction targets for POI and HR were obtained. The protein-protein interaction network of identified interaction targets emphasized the topological importance of AKT1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that HR might regulate POI by modulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. In addition, the KEGG graph of the mTOR signaling pathway revealed that AKT phosphorylation inhibits the TSC1/2, while TSC1/2 activation inhibits the expression of mTORC1. The fundamental experiment revealed that HR increased proliferation, progesterone receptor levels, and estradiol levels decreased by TP in KGN cells. Additionally, HR alleviated TP-induced apoptosis and G1/G1 phase arrest in KGN cells. Western blotting demonstrated that HR increased the phosphorylation of AKT and mTORC1 and decreased TSC1 expression in TP-induced KGN cells. Collectively, our findings revealed that HR alleviates TP-induced granulosa cell injury by regulating AKT/TSC1/mTORC1 signaling, providing insight into the treatment of POI.",

    "title": "Involvement of TSC genes and differential expression of other members of the mTOR signaling pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",
    "issue": "8()",
    "pages": "163",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite extensive research, the five-year survival rate of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients has not improved. Effective treatment of OSCC requires the identification of molecular targets and signaling pathways to design appropriate therapeutic strategies. Several genes from the mTOR signaling pathway are known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancers. However, not much is known about the involvement of this pathway in tumorigenesis of OSCC. We therefore investigated the role of the tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2, and other members of this pathway in tumorigenesis of OSCC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nExpression of genes at the RNA and protein levels was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity was studied using matched blood and tumor DNA samples and microsatellite markers from the TSC1, TSC2 and PTEN candidate regions. The effect of promoter methylation on TSC gene expression was studied by treating cells with methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine. Methylation status of the TSC2 promoter in tissue samples was examined by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed downregulation of TSC1, TSC2, EIF4EBP1 and PTEN, and upregulation of PIK3C2A, AKT1, PDPK1, RHEB, FRAP1, RPS6KB1, EIF4E and RPS6 in tumors. A similar observation was made for AKT1 and RPS6KB1 expression in tumors at the protein level. Investigation of the mechanism of downregulation of TSC genes identified LOH in 36.96% and 39.13% of the tumors at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci, respectively. No mutation was found in TSC genes. A low LOH rate of 13% was observed at the PTEN locus. Treatment of an OSCC cell line with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine showed a significant increase in the expression of TSC genes, suggesting methylation of their promoters. However, the 5-azacytidine treatment of non-OSCC HeLa cells showed a significant increase in the expression of the TSC2 gene only. In order to confirm the results in patient tumor samples, the methylation status of the TSC2 gene promoter was examined by COBRA. The results suggested promoter hypermethylation as an important mechanism for its downregulation. No correlation was found between the presence or absence of LOH at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci in 50 primary tumors to their clinicopathological variables such as age, sex, T classification, stage, grade, histology, tobacco habits and lymph node metastasis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study suggests the involvement of TSC genes and other members of the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of OSCC. LOH and promoter methylation are two important mechanisms for downregulation of TSC genes. We suggest that known inhibitors of this pathway could be evaluated for the treatment of OSCC.",

    "pages": "369-82",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare lung disease, is characterized by the progressive proliferation, migration, and differentiation of smooth muscle (SM)-like LAM cells, which lead to the cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma, obstruction of airways and lymphatics, and loss of pulmonary function. LAM is a disease predominantly affecting women and is exacerbated by pregnancy; only a lung transplant can save the life of a patient. It has been discovered that in LAM, somatic or genetic mutations of tumor suppressor genes tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 occur and the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex functions as a negative regulator of the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway. These two pivotal observations paved the way for the first rapamycin clinical trial for LAM. The recent discoveries that TSC1/TSC2 complex functions as an integrator of signaling networks regulated by growth factors, insulin, nutrients, and energy heightened the interest regarding this rare disease because the elucidation of disease-relevant mechanisms of LAM will promote a better understanding of other metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we will summarize the progress made in our understanding of TSC1/TSC2 cellular signaling and the molecular mechanisms of LAM; we will also highlight some of the lesser explored directions and challenges in LAM research.",

    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin (TOR) is an ancient effector of cell growth that integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients. Two downstream effectors of mammalian TOR, the translational components S6K1 and 4EBP1, are commonly used as reporters of mTOR activity. The conical signaling cascade initiated by growth factors is mediated by PI3K, PKB, TSC1/2 and Rheb. However, the process through which nutrients, i.e., amino acids, activate mTOR remains largely unknown. Evidence exists for both an intracellular and/or a membrane bound sensor for amino acid mediated mTOR activation. Research in eukaryotic models, has implicated amino acid transporters as nutrient sensors. This review describes recent advances in nutrient signaling that impinge on mTOR and its targets including hVps34, class III PI3K, a transducer of nutrient availability to mTOR.",

    "abstract": "The renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are remarkably diverse, including polycystic kidney disease, oncocytomas, renal cell carcinomas, and both benign and malignant angiomyolipomas. All of these occur in children as well as adults with TSC. Benign angiomyolipomas, which can cause spontaneous life-threatening hemorrhage, are by far the most prevalent and the greatest source of morbidity. What is particularly unusual about TSC, setting it apart from virtually all other inherited forms of renal disease, is the abnormalities of both mesenchymal cells (angiomyolipomas) and epithelial cells (cysts, oncocytomas, and carcinomas). Recently, the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex was shown to inhibit the kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This places TSC1/TSC2 at center stage in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth. Furthermore, recent advances in TSC1/TSC2 signaling open the door for targeted therapy for TSC patients. Here, we will address the genetic, cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to the unusually broad spectrum of renal disease in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and consider how the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to other renal diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "The molecular circuitries controlling the process of skin wound healing have gained new significant insights in recent years. This knowledge is built on landmark studies on skin embryogenesis, maturation, and differentiation. Furthermore, the identification, characterization, and elucidation of the biological roles of adult skin epithelial stem cells and their influence in tissue homeostasis have provided the foundation for the overall understanding of the process of skin wound healing and tissue repair. Among numerous signaling pathways associated with epithelial functions, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling route has gained substantial attention with the generation of animal models capable of dissecting individual components of the pathway, thereby providing a novel insight into the molecular framework underlying skin homeostasis and tissue regeneration. In this review, we focus on recent findings regarding the mechanisms involved in wound healing associated with the upregulation of the activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR circuitry. This review highlights critical findings on the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation of mTOR, a downstream component of the PI3K-PTEN pathway, which is directly involved in epithelial migration and proliferation. We discuss how this emerging information can be exploited for the development of novel pharmacological intervention strategies to accelerate the healing of critical size wounds.",

    "title": "The tuberous sclerosis complex genes in tumor development.",
    "issue": "22(4)",
    "pages": "588-603",
    "abstract": "The study of hereditary tumor syndromes has laid a solid foundation toward understanding the genetic basis of cancer. One of the latest examples comes from the study of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). As a member of the phakomatoses, TSC is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, kidney, heart, lung, and skin. While classically described as \"hamartomas,\" the pathology of the lesions has features suggestive of abnormal cellular proliferation, size, differentiation, and migration. Occasionally, tumors progress to become malignant (i.e., renal cell carcinoma). The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Cells undergo bi-allelic inactivation of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor suppressor \"two-hit\" paradigm. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors responsible for Cowden's disease (PTEN), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (LKB1), and familial polyposis (APC). Common sporadic cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, endometrium, and breast have ties to these genes, highlighting the potential role of the TSC proteins in human cancers. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, has potent antitumoral activities in preclinical models of TSC and is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical studies.",

    "pages": "100884",
    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is often referred to as a master regulator of the cellular metabolism that can integrate the growth factor and nutrient signaling. Fasting suppresses hepatic mTORC1 activity via the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a negative regulator of mTORC1, to suppress anabolic metabolism. The loss of TSC1 in the liver locks the liver in a constitutively anabolic state even during fasting, which was suggested to regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling and ketogenesis, but the molecular determinants of this regulation are unknown. Here, we examined if the activation of the mTORC1 complex in mice by the liver-specific deletion of TSC1 (TSC1L-/-) is sufficient to suppress PPARα signaling and therefore ketogenesis in the fasted state. We found that the activation of mTORC1 in the fasted state is not sufficient to repress PPARα-responsive genes or ketogenesis. Furthermore, we examined whether the activation of the anabolic program mediated by mTORC1 complex activation in the fasted state could suppress the robust catabolic programming and enhanced PPARα transcriptional response of mice with a liver-specific defect in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation using carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2L-/-) mice. We generated Cpt2L-/-; Tsc1L-/- double-KO mice and showed that the activation of mTORC1 by deletion of TSC1 could not suppress the catabolic PPARα-mediated phenotype of Cpt2L-/- mice. These data demonstrate that the activation of mTORC1 by the deletion of TSC1 is not sufficient to suppress a PPARα transcriptional program or ketogenesis after fasting.",

    "abstract": "Lethal fungal sepsis causes high morbidity and mortality in intensive care patients. Fungal infections have an immunological basis, and it has been shown in recent studies that decreased CD8+ T-cell count in fungal infections is related to prognosis, while the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, a lethal fungal sepsis model induced by candidemia was created and we found a decreased CD8+ T-cell count and exaggerated apoptosis. Simultaneously, expression of light chain (LC)3B in CD8+ T cells increased, along with increased autophagosomes and accumulation of p62 in infected mice. We regulated the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway using T-cell-specific mTOR/ TSC1 deletion mice. We observed increased number of autophagosomes and expression of LC3B in CD8+T cells after T-cell-specific mTOR knockout, while accumulation of p62 was not ameliorated, and there was no increase in the number of autolysosomes. Apoptosis rate and expression of BIM, a pro-apoptotic gene, decreased in CD8+ T cells in mTOR-deletion mice but increased in TSC1-deletion mice. Our results showed increased CD8+ T-cell death in spleen of lethal fungal sepsis mice, and decreased expression of mTOR ameliorated CD8+ T-cell survival. mTOR may be a possible target to reverse CD8+ T-cell immune dysfunction in lethal fungal sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated renal cell carcinoma (TSC-RCC) has distinct clinical and histopathologic features and is considered a specific subtype of RCC. The genetic alterations of TSC1 or TSC2 are responsible for the development of TSC. In this study, we assessed the mTOR pathway activation and aimed to evaluate molecular characteristics and pathogenic pathways of TSC-RCC. Two cases of TSC-RCC, one from a 31-year-old female and the other from an 8-year-old male, were assessed. The mTOR pathway activation was determined by immunohistochemistry. The mutational spectrum of both TSC-RCCs was evaluated by whole exome sequencing (WES), and pathogenic pathways were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by NanoString Technologies nCounter platform. The mTOR pathway activation and the germline mutations of TSC2 were identified in both TSC-RCC cases. The WES revealed several cancer gene alterations. In Case 1, genetic alterations of CHD8, CRISPLD1, EPB41L4A, GNA11, NOTCH3, PBRM1, PTPRU, RGS12, SETBP1, SMARCA4, STMN1, and ZNRF3 were identified. In Case 2, genetic alterations of IWS1 and TSC2 were identified. Further, putative pathogenic pathways included chromatin remodeling, G protein-coupled receptor, Notch signaling, Wnt/β-catenin, PP2A and the microtubule dynamics pathway in Case 1, and mRNA processing and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in Case 2. Additionally, the ALK and CRLF2 mRNA expression was upregulated and CDH1, MAP3K1, RUNX1, SETBP1, and TSC1 mRNA expression was downregulated in both TSC-RCCs. We present mTOR pathway activation and molecular characteristics with pathogenic pathways in TSC-RCCs, which will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of TSC-RCC.",

    "pages": "1932-1948",
    "abstract": "While constant basal levels of macroautophagy/autophagy are a prerequisite to preserve long-lived podocytes at the filtration barrier, MTOR regulates at the same time podocyte size and compensatory hypertrophy. Since MTOR is known to generally suppress autophagy, the apparently independent regulation of these two key pathways of glomerular maintenance remained puzzling. We now report that long-term genetic manipulation of MTOR activity does in fact not influence high basal levels of autophagy in podocytes either in vitro or in vivo. Instead we present data showing that autophagy in podocytes is mainly controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 (unc-51 like kinase 1). Pharmacological inhibition of MTOR further shows that the uncoupling of MTOR activity and autophagy is time dependent. Together, our data reveal a novel and unexpected cell-specific mechanism, which permits concurrent MTOR activity as well as high basal autophagy rates in podocytes. Thus, these data indicate manipulation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis rather than inhibition of MTOR as a promising therapeutic intervention to enhance autophagy and preserve podocyte homeostasis in glomerular diseases.

    "issue": "41(39)",
    "pages": "8134-8149",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by hamartomas in various organs, such as the brain, lungs, and kidneys. Epilepsy, along with autism and intellectual disability, is one of the neurologic impairments associated with TSC that has an intimate relationship with developmental outcomes and quality of life. Sustained activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via TSC1 or TSC2 mutations is known to be involved in the onset of epilepsy in TSC. However, the mechanism by which mTOR causes seizures remains unknown. In this study, we showed that, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived TSC2-deficient (TSC2-/-) neurons exhibited elevated neuronal activity with highly synchronized Ca2+ spikes. Notably, TSC2-/- neurons presented enhanced Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs), which contributed to the abnormal neurite extension and sustained activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity. Expression of Cav1.3, a subtype of LTCCs, was increased in TSC2-/- neurons, but long-term rapamycin treatment suppressed this increase and reversed the altered neuronal activity and neurite extensions. Thus, we identified Cav1.3 LTCC as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling that would trigger enhanced neuronal network activity of TSC2-/- neurons. We suggest that LTCCs could be potential novel targets for the treatment of epilepsy in TSC.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is a close relationship between elevated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).

In this study, using human TSC2-/- neurons, we identified elevated Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling and a potential cause of both elevated neuronal activity and neurite extension in TSC2-/- neurons.

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mutations in Tsc1 or Tsc2 that lead to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) hyperactivity. Patients with TSC suffer from intractable seizures resulting from cortical malformations known as tubers, but research into how these tubers form has been limited because of the lack of an animal model. To address this limitation, we used in utero electroporation to knock out Tsc1 in selected neuronal populations in mice heterozygous for a mutant Tsc1 allele that eliminates the Tsc1 gene product at a precise developmental time point. Knockout of Tsc1 in single cells led to increased mTOR activity and soma size in the affected neurons. The mice exhibited white matter heterotopic nodules and discrete cortical tuber-like lesions containing cytomegalic and multinucleated neurons with abnormal dendritic trees resembling giant cells. Cortical tubers in the mutant mice did not exhibit signs of gliosis. Furthermore, phospho-S6 immunoreactivity was not upregulated in Tsc1-null astrocytes despite a lower seizure threshold. Collectively, these data suggest that a double-hit strategy to eliminate Tsc1 in discrete neuronal populations generates TSC-associated cortical lesions, providing a model to uncover the mechanisms of lesion formation and cortical hyperexcitability. In addition, the absence of glial reactivity argues against a contribution of astrocytes to lesion-associated hyperexcitability.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most common intracranial tumors, pituitary tumor is associated with high morbidity. Effective therapy is currently not available for some pituitary tumors due to the largely undefined pathological processes of pituitary tumorigenesis. In this study, hyperactivation of mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was observed in estrogen-induced rat pituitary tumor and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocked the tumor development. Pituitary knockout of either mTOR signaling pathway negative regulator Tsc1 or Pten caused mouse pituitary prolactinoma, which was abolished by rapamycin treatment. Mechanistically, the expression of pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) was upregulated in an mTOR complex 1-dependent manner. Overexpressed PTTG1 was crucial in hyperactive mTOR-mediated tumorigenesis. mTOR-PTTG1 signaling axis may be targeted for the treatment of tumors with mTOR hyperactivation.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated signaling by the checkpoint kinase TOR (target of rapamycin) has been linked to numerous human cancers. The tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2 form a protein complex that integrates and transmits cellular growth factor and stress signals to negatively regulate TOR activity. Several recent reports have identified the stress response gene REDD1 as an essential regulator of TOR activity through the TSC1/2 complex in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. REDD1 is induced in response both to hypoxia and energy stress, and cells that lack REDD1 exhibit highly defective TOR regulation in response to either of these stress signals. While the precise mechanism of REDD1 function remains to be determined, the finding that REDD1-dependent TOR regulation contributes to cell growth/cell size control in flies and mammals suggests that abnormalities of REDD1-mediated signaling might disrupt energy homeostasis and/or promote tumorigenesis.",

    "pages": "3018-3026",
    "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis renders liver more vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), which commonly occurs in transplantation, trauma, and liver resection. The underlying mechanism is not fully characterized. We aimed to clarify the role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) in normal and steatotic liver using Alb-TSC1-/- (AT) and Alb-mTOR-/- (Am) transgenic mice. Steatotic liver induced by high-fat diet was more vulnerable to IRI. Activation of hepatic mTOR in AT mice decreased lipid accumulation attenuated HIRI as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, circulating levels of alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, and inflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), TNF-α, and IL-6 and hepatic cleaved caspase 3 in mice fed either a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet. The effects of mTOR activation on hepatic cleaved caspase 3 were reversed by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling. Inhibition of hepatic mTOR in Am mice increased hepatic lipid deposition and HIRI. The increment in hepatic susceptibility to IRI was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with IKKβ inhibitor. Further, suppression of mTOR facilitated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. In conclusion, our study suggests that mTOR activity in hepatocytes decreases hepatic vulnerability to injury through a mechanism dependent on NF-κB proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway in both normal and steatotic liver.-Li, Z., Zhang, J., Mulholland, M., Zhang, W. mTOR activation protects liver from ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury through NF-κB pathway.",

    "issue": "48(3)",
    "pages": "139-49",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disease characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas and benign or rarely malignant neoplasms distributed at various sites throughout the body, especially in the brain, skin, retina, kidney, heart, and lungs. Brain lesions in TSC include: cortical/subcortical glioneuronal tubers, subependymal glial nodules (SENs), and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Cortical tubers are characterized by a markedly disorganized cortical lamination with dysplastic aggregates of abnormal glial and neuronal elements, including giant cells. SENs consist of large cells, somewhat similar to the giant cells seen in tubers, accompanied by elongated glial cells. SENs are typically covered by a layer of ependyma and can grow over time and develop into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. SEGAs consist of a mixed cell population of large ganglioid-like cells, spindle and giant cells with nuclear pleomorphism. Mitotic activity and necrosis might be observed in SEGAs but they should not be considered as features of malignancy. The clinical presentations of TSC result from mutations in either of two tumour suppressor genes: TSC1 (located on 9q34) or TSC2 (located on 16p13). The proteins encoded by TSC1 and TSC2 genes, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a heterodimer which suppresses the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major cell growth and proliferation controller. Oral rapamycin therapy may induce regression of astrocytomas associated with TSC. In this review, the clinicopathological features of TCS and recent advantages in the diagnosis and genetics of TSC are presented.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac rhabdomyoma (CR) is the most common heart tumor in children and is usually associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in either of 2 genes (TSC1 or TSC2) and characterized by the formation of hamartomas in multiple organs. The 2 TSC proteins, hamartin and tuberin, antagonize the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, thus regulating cell growth and proliferation. Recently, some trials treating TSC with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin have been published; however, the impact of such treatment on heart tumors is not known. The aim of the present paper was to study the molecular pathobiology of CRs. Six CR samples were studied. The expression of S6K1, pErk, Erk, Akt, pAkt, 4E-BP1, hamartin, tuberin, mTOR, bcl-2, Bax, and Ki-67 was examined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods. Increased expression of Bax, mTOR, pS6K, pErk, and 4E-BP1 was found in all CR samples. Hamartin and tuberin expression was decreased in tumors versus normal heart tissues. This is the first study showing mTOR pathway dysregulation and an increased expression of proapoptotic Bax protein in CRs associated with TSC.",

    "issue": "21(2)",
    "pages": "85-95",
    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and motility. Structural alterations, e.g. airway remodeling, in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell growth and proliferation due to the frequent stimulation of ASM by inflammatory mediators, contractile agonists, and growth factors. The critical role of the PI3K signaling pathway in regulating ASM cell growth and proliferation is well established. However, recent discovery of the tumor suppressor proteins tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin, as downstream effectors of PI3K and upstream regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase 1(S6K1) shed a new light on the PI3K signaling cascade in regulating cell growth and proliferation. The activity of TSC1/TSC2 is regulated by growth factors, nutrients, and energy; thus, TSC1/TSC2 serves as a signaling module for protein translational regulation, cell cycle progression, and cell size, which are key events controlling cell growth and proliferation. This article highlights the potential contribution of the PI3K-TSC1/TSC2-mTOR/S6K1 pathway in smooth muscle remodeling. Pharmacologic manipulation of this signaling pathway could have a major impact on treatment of asthma and COPD.",

    "abstract": "The TSC1-TSC2 complex has recently been implicated in cell survival responses. We observed that NF-kappaB signaling is attenuated in TSC1- and TSC2-deficient MEFs concomitant with reduced survival following DNA damage or TNFalpha stimulation. Reconstitution of TSC2 expression in TSC2(-/-) MEFs rescued survival in an NF-kappaB activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, in TSC2(-/-) MEFs, the rapamycin-mediated inhibition of deregulated mTOR activity restored NF-kappaB activation and survival. This rapamycin-mediated effect was reversed by inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activation or by inhibition of ERK1/2 MAP kinase or PI-3K pathways, which lie on signaling cascades that lead to NF-kappaB activation. These results provide evidence for a crosstalk between the TSC/Rheb/mTOR pathway and the NF-kappaB induction pathways and indicate that NF-kappaB functions as an important survival factor that regulates TSC2-dependent cell survival.",

    "abstract": "Tic spectrum disorder (TSD) is an umbrella term which includes Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD). They are considered highly heritable, yet the genetic components remain largely unknown. In this study we aimed to investigate disease-associated DNA methylation differences to identify genes and pathways which may be implicated in TSD aetiology. For this purpose, we performed an exploratory analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in whole blood samples of 16 monozygotic twin pairs, of which eight were discordant and six concordant for TSD, while two pairs were asymptomatic. Although no sites reached genome-wide significance, we identified several sites and regions with a suggestive significance, which were located within or in the vicinity of genes with biological functions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The two top genes identified (TSC1 and CRYZ/TYW3) and the enriched pathways and components (phosphoinosides and PTEN pathways, and insulin receptor substrate binding) are related to, or have been associated with, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Genes in this pathway have previously been associated with GTS, and mTOR signalling has been implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. It is thus possible that altered mTOR signalling plays a role in the complex pathogenesis of TSD.",

    "abstract": "Germline TSC1 or TSC2 mutations cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a hamartoma syndrome with lung involvement. To explore the potential interaction between TSC1 and KRAS activation in lung cancer, mice in which Tsc1 loss and Kras(G12D) expression occur in a small fraction of lung epithelial cells were generated. Mice with a combined Tsc1-Kras(G12D) mutation had dramatically reduced tumor latency (median survival: 11.6-15.6 weeks) in comparison with Kras(G12D) alone mutant mice (median survival: 27.5 weeks). Tsc1-Kras(G12D) tumors showed consistent activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)C1 and responded to treatment with rapamycin, leading to significantly improved survival, whereas rapamycin had minor effects on cancers in Kras(G12D) alone mice. Loss of heterozygosity for TSC1 or TSC2 was found in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, none of the 80 lung cancer lines studied showed evidence of the lack of expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 or a signaling pattern corresponding to complete loss. These data indicate that Tsc1 loss synergizes with the Kras mutation to enhance lung tumorigenesis in the mouse, but that this is a rare event in human lung cancer. Rapamycin may have unique benefit for patients with lung cancer, for whom the TSC1/TSC2 function is limited.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells are of mesenchymal cell type located in the space of Disse. Upon liver injury, HSCs transactivate into myofibroblasts with increase in expression of fibrillar collagen, especially collagen I and III, leading to liver fibrosis. Previous studies have shown mTOR signaling is activated during liver fibrosis. However, there is no direct evidence in vivo. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of conditional deletion of TSC1 in mesenchymal on pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Crossing mice bearing the floxed TSC1 gene with mice harboring Col1α2-Cre-ER(T) successfully generated progeny with a conditional knockout of TSC1 (TSC1 CKO) in collagen I expressing mesenchymal cells. TSC1 CKO and WT mice were subjected to CCl4, oil or CCl4+ rapamycin treatment for 8 weeks. TSC1 CKO mice developed pronounced liver fibrosis relative to WT mice, as examined by ALT, hydroxyproline, histopathology, and profibrogenic gene. Absence of TSC1 in mesenchymal cells induced proliferation and prevented apoptosis in activated HSCs. However, there were no significant differences in oil-treated TSC1 CKO and WT mice. Rapamycin, restored these phenotypic changes by preventing myofibroblasts proliferation and enhancing their apoptosis. These findings revealed mTOR overactivation in mesenchymal cells aggravates CCl4- induced liver fibrosis and the rapamycin prevent its occurance.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNesfatin-1, an 82 amino acid peptide derived from the prohormone nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2), is a novel satiety hormone acting through a leptin-independent mechanism in the hypothalamus. The mechanisms by which production of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 is regulated remain unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNesfatin-1/NUCB2 mRNA and immunoreactivity were examined in gastric tissue and Min-6 cells by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining or Western blotting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNesfatin-1/NUCB2 is co-localized with pS6K1, the downstream target of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in gastric X/A like cells. A parallel relationship between gastric mTOR signaling and nesfatin-1/NUCB2 was observed during changes in energy status. Both mTOR activity and gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2 were down-regulated by fasting, and returned to basal levels with re-feeding. In high fat diet induced obese mice, gastric mTOR signaling and nesfatin-1/NUCB2 were increased. Inhibition of the gastric mTOR signaling by rapamycin attenuated the expression of gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2 mRNA and protein in both lean and obese mice. Attenuation of mTOR activity by rapamycin or over-expression of TSC1 or TSC2 reduced the expression of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 in Min-6 cells, suggesting a direct effect of mTOR signaling.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGastric mTOR is a gastric energy sensor whose activity is linked to the regulation of gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2.",

    "abstract": "The LKB1 tumor suppressor protein controls the activity of the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex. Mutations in LKB1 cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), and mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause tuberous sclerosis complex--two syndromes characterized by the development of hamartomas. LKB1 activation by energy deprivation activates AMPK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates TSC2. TSC2 activation results in the inactivation of mTOR, a critical regulator of protein translation. How mTOR dysregulation after inactivation of LKB1 or TSC1/2 contributes to hamartoma development is not known. However, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and VEGF are regulated by mTOR and are likely to play a contributory role.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an inherited tumour syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 that lead to aberrant activation of mTOR. Tumour responses in TSC patients to rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR, or its analogs are partial and reversible probably due to feedback activation of Akt. In this study, we examined the efficacy of GSK2126458, an ATP-competitive dual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR, in comparison to rapamycin for treatment of renal tumours in genetically engineered Tsc2+/- mice. We found that both GSK2126458 and rapamycin caused significant reduction in number and size of solid renal tumours. GSK2126458 also significantly reduced the number and size of all lesions (cystic, papillary and solid) although to a lesser extent compared to rapamycin. GSK2126458 inhibited both PI3K and mTOR while rapamycin exerted stronger inhibitory effect on mTORC1 in renal tumours. Furthermore, GSK2126458 and rapamycin suppressed proliferation of tumour cells. Importantly, GSK2126458 increased apoptosis of solid tumours but rapamycin did not. Further investigations are therefore needed to test whether rapamycin in combination with GSK2126458 could promote apoptosis and thus improve therapy of TSC-associated renal tumours.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nSubependymal ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) occur almost exclusively in the setting of tuberous sclerosis (TSC). They are low-grade gliomas which typically produce clinical symptoms through either mass effect or hydrocephalus. As do other manifestations of tuberous sclerosis, these lesions result from mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene. These mutations cause hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). In view of their tendency to grow slowly, clinical symptoms usually only occur when the tumors reach a considerable size. Therapy can involve surgical resection, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, or medical therapy with an mTOR inhibitor.\n\n\nAREAS COVERED\nHerein, the authors discuss the diagnosis, symptoms, and practical management of SEGAs as well as providing their expert opinion.\n\n\nEXPERT OPINION\nmTOR inhibitors have largely replaced surgery as the primary modality for the management of SEGAs. Surgical treatment is largely limited to tumors that present with acute hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. Patients with TSC should undergo periodic screening with CT or preferably MRI scans of the brain from childhood to approximately age 25 to identify SEGAs which require treatment. In addition to avoiding potential morbidity associated with surgical resection, mTOR inhibitors have the potential to improve the clinical status of tuberous sclerosis patients generally.",

Its neurological manifestations include epilepsy, autism, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, and giant cell tumors. A mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 can cause tuberous sclerosis complex. Their two gene products, hamartin and tuberin, form a physical complex which normally inhibits protein synthesis mediated through the mechanistic target of rapamycin, so a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation results in overactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin cascade. In addition to their tumor suppressor roles, TSC1 and TSC2 help to regulate cell size, neuronal migration, axon formation, and synaptic plasticity. Clinical trials of two different the mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors have demonstrated substantial improvement of tuberous sclerosis complex-related tumors, and a recent trial also showed a benefit from the mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in the treatment of refractory epilepsy due to tuberous sclerosis complex. Effective mechanism-based therapy is now available for some manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex.",

LAM occurs sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex. LAM may present with dyspnea, recurrent pneumothorax or chylothorax. Pulmonary function tests show reduced flow rates and lung diffusion capacity. Exercise testing may reveal hypoxemia and ventilatory limitation. The severity and progression of disease may be assessed by computer tomography, and pulmonary function and exercise testing. mTOR inhibitors, (e.g., sirolimus) are effective in stabilizing lung function, and reducing the size of chylous effusions, lymphangioleiomyomas, and angiomyolipomas.\n\n\nEXPERT OPINION\nDifferent clinical phenotypes including variable rates of disease progression and variable responses to therapy are seen in LAM patients. No one test is available that predicts the course of disease at the time of diagnosis. Further research regarding the molecular biology of LAM clinical phenotypes is warranted.

Tubers are cortical developmental malformations in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex that are associated with intractable epilepsy and are composed of histologically distinct cell types, including giant cells and dysplastic neurons. We recently showed that tubers can be dynamic lesions characterized by populations of cells undergoing proliferation, migration, and death. We demonstrate that there is cell-specific activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6 kinase/ribosomal S6 cascade in tubers and that giant cells express activated (phosphorylated) p70S6 kinase and ribosomal S6 protein. These findings support impaired hamartin- and tuberin-mediated mTOR pathway regulation.

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multi-system disorder, primary manifestations of which are benign tumors and lesions in various organs of the body, including the brain. TSC patients often suffer from epilepsy, mental retardation, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, TSC serves as a model of epilepsy, ASD, and tumorigenesis. TSC is caused by the lack of functional Tsc1-Tsc2 complex, which serves as a major cellular inhibitor of mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 is a kinase controlling most of anabolic processes in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, mTORC1 inhibitors, such as rapamycin, serve as experimental or already approved drugs for several TSC symptoms. However, rapalogs, although quite effective, need to be administered chronically and likely for a lifetime, since therapy discontinuation results in tumor regrowth and epilepsy recurrence. Recent studies revealed that metabolism and excitability (in the case of neurons) of cells lacking Tsc1-Tsc2 complex are changed, and these features may potentially be used to treat some of TSC symptoms. In this review, we first provide basic facts about TSC and its molecular background, to next discuss the newest findings in TSC cell biology that can be used to improve existing therapies of TSC and other diseases linked to mTORC1 hyperactivation. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(12):955-962, 2016.",

    "issue": "8(24)",
    "pages": "4168-75",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central promotor of cell growth and proliferation. The protein product of the TSC1 gene, hamartin (referred to as TSC1) is known to interact with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in a cell cycle regulated, phosphorylation-dependent manner. We hypothesized that the p53 target gene, Plk2, is a tumor suppressor, mediating its tumor suppressor function through interactions with TSC1 that facilitate TSC1/2 restraint of mTOR under hypoxic stress. We found that human lung tumor cells deficient in Plk2 grew larger than control tumors, and that Plk2 interacts with endogenous TSC1 protein. Additionally, C-terminal Plk2-GST fusion protein bound both TSC1 and TSC2 proteins. TSC1 levels were elevated in response to Adriamycin and cells transiently overexpressing Plk2 demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of the downstream target of mTOR, ribosomal protein p70S6 kinase during hypoxia. Plk2 levels were inversely correlated with cytoplasmic p70S6K phosphorylation. Plk2 levels did not increase in response to DNA damage (Adriamycin, CPT -11) when HCT 116 and H460 cells were exposed to hypoxia. TSC1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with TSC1 added back demonstrated decreased S6K phosphorylation, which was further decreased when Plk2 was transiently overexpressed. Interestingly, under normoxia, Plk2 deficient tumor cells demonstrated increased apoptosis in response to various chemotherapeutic agents including CPT -11 but increased resistance to apoptotic death after CPT-11 treatment under hypoxia, and tumor xenografts comprised of these Plk2-deficient cells were resistant to CPT -11. Our results point to a novel Plk2-TSC1 interaction with effects on mTOR signaling during hypoxia, and tumor growth that may enable targeting Plk2 signaling in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Proliferation, migration, and differentiation of smooth muscle (SM)-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) cells in the lungs are pathologic manifestations of pulmonary LAM, a rare lung disease predominantly afflicting women and exacerbated by pregnancy. LAM cells form nodules throughout the lung without any predominant localization, but can also form small cell clusters dispersed within lung parenchyma. LAM cells have the appearance of \"immature\" SM-like cells, irregularly distributed within the nodule in contrast to organized SM cell layers in airways and vasculature. Progressive growth of LAM cells leads to the cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma, obstruction of airways and lymphatics, and loss of pulmonary function. Pathogenetically, LAM occurs from somatic or genetic mutations of tumor suppressor genes tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2. The TSC1/TSC2 protein complex is an integrator of signaling networks regulated by growth factors, insulin, nutrients, and energy. The observation that the TSC1/TSC2 functions as a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) signaling pathway yielded the first rapamycin clinical trial for LAM. Although LAM is a rare lung disease, the elucidation of disease-relevant mechanisms of LAM will provide a better understanding of not only SM-like cell growth, migration, and differentiation in LAM but may also offer insights into other metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In this article, we will summarize the progress made in our understanding of LAM, and we will focus on how dysregulation of TSC1/TSC2 signaling results in abnormal proliferation and migration of SM-like LAM cells.",

We demonstrate here that microRNA-19a (\"miR-19a\", -3p) targets the 3' untranslated regions of TSC1 mRNA. Expression of miR-19a downregulated TSC1 in OB-6 osteoblastic cells and primary human osteoblasts. miR-19a activated mTORC1 and protected human osteoblasts from dexamethasone. mTORC1 inhibition, by RAD001 or Raptor shRNA, almost completely abolished miR-19a-induced osteoblast cytoprotection against dexamethasone. Knockdown of TSC1 by targeted shRNA similarly induced mTORC1 activation and protected osteoblasts. Moreover, miR-19a activated mTORC1-dependent NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and inhibited dexamethasone-induced reactive oxygen species production in osteoblasts. Together, miR-19a protects human osteoblasts from dexamethasone possibly via targeting TSC1-mTORC1 signaling.",

    "pages": "2533-2542",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe use of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) following liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Sirolimus is a typical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and tuberous sclerosis 1-tuberous sclerosis 2 complex (TSC1/TSC2) is an important negative effector in the mTOR pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of SRL-based immunosuppression on the prognosis of LT recipients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria based on TSC1/2 expression and explored the effect of TSC1 on HCC in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed 120 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. All patients had HCC beyond the Milan criteria and were divided into the SRL group (n = 50) and non-SRL group (n = 70). TSC1/2 expression levels in paraffin-embedded tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then analyzed as subgroups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. TSC1 expression was silenced in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 cell lines for further cell function experiments.\n\n\nRESULTS\n88.3% of patients were HBV LT recipients. The SRL group exhibited better DFS and OS compared to the non-SRL group (P = 0.02, P = 0.003). Subgroup (TSC1-based or TSC2-based) analyses revealed that patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 expression benefited from sirolimus (DFS: P = 0.046, OS: P = 0.006 for TSC1; DFS: P = 0.05, OS: P = 0.003 for TSC2) compared with patients with high expression. TSC1 knockdown in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines activated the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, migration and sensitivity to SRL in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTSC1/2 expression could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent SRL-based immunosuppression following LT. TSC1 knockdown promoted HCC malignancy and enhanced sensitivity to SRL.",

    "abstract": "RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1) is a novel tumor suppressor implicated in the regulation of RB1 expression. It is abundant in post-mitotic neuromuscular cells, which are matured and enlarged, but scarce in smaller leukocytes, indicating an association between RB1CC1 status and cell size. To clarify whether RB1CC1 is involved in cell size control, we investigated the contribution of RB1CC1 to the TSC-mTOR pathway, which plays an important role in the control through translational regulation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of RB1CC1 reduced the activation of mTOR and S6K as well as the size of HEK293 and C2C12 cells. Such knockdown also suppressed RB1 expression and the population of G1-phase cells. Exogenous expression of RB1CC1 maintained S6K activity and cell size, and decreased TSC1/hamartin contents under nutritionally starved conditions, which usually inhibit the mTOR-S6K pathway. Furthermore, RB1CC1 interfered with and degraded TSC1 through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. A lentiviral RNAi for RB1CC1 reduced the size of mouse leg muscles. These findings suggest that RB1CC1 is required to maintain both RB1 expression and mTOR activity. The activity of mTOR was supported by RB1CC1 through TSC1 degradation. RB1CC1 preserved cell size without cell cycle progression especially in neuromuscular tissues, and the abundance contributed to the non-proliferating enlarged cell phenotype.",

    "abstract": "BCAAs stimulate protein synthesis in in vitro preparations of skeletal muscle. Likewise, the stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle produced by intake of a mixed meal is due largely to BCAAs. Of the three BCAAs, leucine is the one primarily responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis under these circumstances. The stimulatory effect of leucine on protein synthesis is mediated through upregulation of the initiation of mRNA translation. A number of mechanisms, including phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 Kinase, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E binding protein-1, and eIF4G, contribute to the effect of leucine on translation initiation. These mechanisms not only promote global translation of mRNA but also contribute to processes that mediate discrimination in the selection of mRNA for translation. A key component in a signaling pathway controlling these phosphorylation-induced mechanisms is the protein kinase, termed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The activity of mTOR toward downstream targets is controlled in part through its interaction with the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (known as raptor) and the G protein beta-subunit-like protein. Signaling through mTOR is also controlled by upstream members of the pathway such as the Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a GTPase that activates mTOR, and tuberin (also known as TSC2), a GTPase-activating protein, which, with its binding partner hamartin (also known as TSC1), acts to repress mTOR. Candidates for mediating the action of leucine to stimulate signaling through the mTOR pathway include TSC2, Rheb, and raptor. The current state of our understanding of how leucine acts on these signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms to stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is summarized in this article.",

These models can be established from a patient's own cells and can be genetically engineered to generate isogenic, controlled systems for mechanistic studies. Given the challenges of obtaining and working with primary human brain tissue, these models fill a critical gap in our understanding of normal and abnormal human brain development and provide an important complement to animal models. Recently, there has been major progress in modeling the neuropathophysiology of the canonical \"mTORopathy\" tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with such approaches. Studies using two- and three-dimensional cultures of human neurons and glia have provided new insights into how mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes impact human neural development and function. Here we discuss recent progress in human stem cell-based modeling of TSC and highlight challenges and opportunities for further efforts in this area.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of cellular growth, proliferation, and more in general, is a common phenomenon in most types of cancers. Thus, natural substances targeting this pathway can be of great therapeutic potential in supporting the treatment of tumor patients. Rhus tripartita (Ucria) Grande is a plant growing in desertic areas which is traditionally used for the treatment of several diseases in Tunisia. In the present work, the biochemical profile of the main compounds present in the plant leaf extract was determined and the anti-leukemic potential of the plant extracts against acute monocytic leukaemia (AML) THP-1 cells was investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter HPLC identification of some phenolic compounds present in the plant extract and the quantification of saponin content, the cytotoxic effect of Rhus tripartita extracts on THP-1 cell culture was evaluated using the colorimetric MTT assay for cell viability. THP-1 cells were incubated with medium containing the relative IC50 concentrations of total plant extract, saponin extract and some standard compounds (rutin (R); kaempferol (K); mixture of catechin, epicatechin, and epicatechin-gallate (CEEG); ellagic acid (EA). Finally, qRT-PCR and western blotting analysis were used to evaluate the effect of some flavonoids present in a crude extract of polyphenols and the total extract of saponins on cell survival and apoptosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of expression level of some gene (PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, mTOR, EIF4E, RPS6KB1, and TSC1) involved in the mTOR pathway and the phosphorylation of S6 and AKT proteins allowed to observe that a total Rhus tripartita extract and some of the compounds found in the extract controls THP-1 cell proliferation and apoptosis via regulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRhus tripartita-induced inhibition of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis may involve the mTOR pathway. Therefore, Rhus tripartita extract may be a useful candidate as a natural anti-cancer drug to support the treatment of AML.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nUterine perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare mesenchymal tumors. Many have malignant behavior, and no successful treatment strategy has been established. Identification of mutations in the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 genes producing constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway presents an opportunity for targeted therapy. Patients with advanced malignant uterine PEComa treated with mTOR inhibitors were identified and records were retrospectively reviewed for treatment response based on radiographic assessment. Three patients with advanced uterine PEComas underwent debulking surgery followed by mTOR inhibitor therapy; two had a complete response to therapy and disease in one patient progressed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the absence of effective therapies for malignant uterine PEComas, targeting the mTOR pathway is a logical strategy to pursue given the known pathobiology involving the Tuberous Sclerosis complex. Treatment of malignant uterine PEComas with mTOR inhibitors was effective in two out of three patients after surgical resection, with durable response.",

    "issue": "10(4)",
    "pages": "404-15",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multiple organ system disorder that is characterized by the development of tumor-like lesions (hamartomas) and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes occur in the majority of patients with TSC, resulting in hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and subsequent abnormalities in numerous cell processes. As a result, mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus have the potential to provide targeted therapy for patients with TSC. Everolimus is the first mTOR inhibitor approved as a treatment option in the USA and in Europe for patients with subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) associated with TSC. The clinical evidence to date supports the use of mTOR inhibitors in a variety of TSC-associated disease manifestations, including SEGAs, renal angiomyolipoma, skin manifestations, and epilepsy. Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials evaluating mTOR inhibitors in TSC are underway, and the results of these studies are expected to provide further evidence that will firmly establish their role in this setting. This article will discuss the role of the mTOR pathway in TSC and review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of mTOR inhibitors, along with their current place in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Nephrogenesis concludes by the 36th week of gestation in humans and by the third day of postnatal life in mice. Extending the nephrogenic period may reduce the onset of adult renal and cardiovascular disease associated with low nephron numbers. We conditionally deleted either Mtor or Tsc1 (coding for hamartin, an inhibitor of Mtor) in renal progenitor cells. Loss of one Mtor allele caused a reduction in nephron numbers; complete deletion led to severe paucity of glomeruli in the kidney resulting in early death after birth. By contrast, loss of one Tsc1 allele from renal progenitors resulted in a 25% increase in nephron endowment with no adverse effects. Increased progenitor engraftment rates ex vivo relative to controls correlated with prolonged nephrogenesis through the fourth postnatal day. Complete loss of both Tsc1 alleles in renal progenitors led to a lethal tubular lesion. The hamartin phenotypes are not dependent on the inhibitory effect of TSC on the Mtor complex but are dependent on Raptor.",

    "title": "Effects of antiepileptic drugs in a new TSC/mTOR-dependent epilepsy mouse model.",
    "issue": "6(7)",
    "pages": "1273-1291",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAn epilepsy mouse model for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) was developed and validated to investigate the mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. Furthermore, the possible antiepileptogenic properties of commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and new compounds were assessed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTsc1 deletion was induced in CAMK2A-expressing neurons of adult mice. The antiepileptogenic properties of commonly used AEDs and inhibitors of the mTOR pathways were assessed by EEG recordings and by molecular read outs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMice developed epilepsy in a narrow time window (10 ± 2 days) upon Tsc1 gene deletion. Seizure frequency but not duration increased over time. Seizures were lethal within 18 days, were unpredictable, and did not correlate to seizure onset, length or frequency, reminiscent of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Tsc1 gene deletion resulted in a strong activation of the mTORC1 pathway, and both epileptogenesis and lethality could be entirely prevented by RHEB1 gene deletion or rapamycin treatment. However, other inhibitors of the mTOR pathway such as AZD8055 and PF4708671 were ineffective. Except for ketogenic diet, none of commonly used AEDs showed an effect on mTORC1 activity. Vigabatrin and ketogenic diet treatment were able to significantly delay seizure onset. In contrast, survival was shortened by lamotrigine.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThis novel Tsc1 mouse model is highly suitable to assess the efficacy of antiepileptic and -epileptogenic drugs to treat mTORC1-dependent epilepsy. Additionally, it allows us to study the mechanisms underlying mTORC1-mediated epileptogenesis and SUDEP. We found that early treatment with vigabatrin was not able to prevent epilepsy, but significantly delayed seizure onset.",

    "issue": "58(8)",
    "pages": "1887-97",
    "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS\nGlucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), an intestinal incretin produced in L cells through proglucagon processing, is released in response to meal intake. The intracellular mechanism by which L cells sense the organism energy level to coordinate the production of GLP-1 remains unclear. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular fuel sensor critical for energy homeostasis. In this study, we investigated whether intestinal mTOR regulates GLP-1 production in L cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effects of mTOR on GLP-1 production were examined in lean- or high-fat diet (HFD) induced diabetic C57/BL6, db/db, Neurog3-Tsc1(-/-) mice, and STC-1 cells. GLP-1 expression was investigated by real-time PCR and western blotting. Plasma GLP-1 and insulin were detected by enzyme immunoassay and radioimmunoassay, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFasting downregulated mTOR activity, which was associated with a decrement of intestinal proglucagon and circulating GLP-1. Upon re-feeding, these alterations returned to the levels of fed animals. In HFD induced diabetic mice, ileal mTOR signalling, proglucagon and circulating GLP-1 were significantly decreased. Inhibition of mTOR signalling by rapamycin decreased levels of intestinal and plasma GLP-1 in both normal and diabetic mice. Activation of the intestinal mTOR signalling by L-leucine or Tsc1 gene deletion increased levels of intestinal proglucagon and plasma GLP-1. Overexpression of mTOR stimulated proglucagon promoter activity and GLP-1 production, whereas inhibition of mTOR activity by overexpression of tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 decreased proglucagon promoter activity and GLP-1 production in STC-1 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION\nmTOR may link energy supply with the production of GLP-1 in L cells.",

    "issue": "176(4)",
    "pages": "1878-90",
    "abstract": "Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are rare brain tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a disease caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in enhancement of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, dysregulation of cell growth, and tumorigenesis. Signaling via mTOR plays a role in multifaceted genomic responses, but its effectors in the brain are largely unknown. Therefore, gene expression profiling on four SEGAs was performed with Affymetrix Human Genome arrays. Of the genes differentially expressed in TSC, 11 were validated by real-time PCR on independent tumor samples and 3 SEGA-derived cultures. Expression of several proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The differentially-regulated proteins were mainly involved in tumorigenesis and nervous system development. ANXA1, GPNMB, LTF, RND3, S100A11, SFRP4, and NPTX1 genes were likely to be mTOR effector genes in SEGA, as their expression was modulated by an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, in SEGA-derived cells. Inhibition of mTOR signaling affected size of cultured SEGA cells but had no influence on their proliferation, morphology, or migration, whereas inhibition of both mTOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways led to significant alterations of these processes. For the first time, we identified genes related to the occurrence of SEGA and regulated by mTOR and demonstrated an effective modulation of SEGA growth by pharmacological inhibition of both mTOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways, which could represent a novel therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) has recently been described as a distinct renal tumor. LOT shows consistent morphologic features and a CK7-positive/CD117-negative immunophenotype. To examine the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of LOT, we searched our institutional archives and identified seven cases of LOT. All patients were female, with a mean age of 66 years (range 44-79 years). The average tumor size was 3.2 cm (range 1.6-5.5 cm). Macroscopically, the tumors showed tan-brown and solid cut surfaces. Microscopically, the tumors showed compact nested to solid growth pattern, three cases with areas of edematous stroma containing loosely connected small clusters, cords or dispersed single tumor cells. The tumor cells had uniformly round to oval nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and showed perinuclear halos. Two cases focally had nuclear irregularities and binucleated cells were occasionally seen in three cases. Immunohistochemically, diffuse positivity for CK7 and lack of CD117 expression were present in all cases. All of the tumors were negative for CD10, CK20, vimentin, CA9, TFE3, TFEB, HMB45, and Melan-A. All tumors were positive for MTOR and negative for Cathepsin-K. FH and SDHB were retained. Next generation sequencing identified genetic variations in the MTOR pathway related genes: TSC1 (4/7), TSC2 (5/7), and MTOR (1/7). All patients were alive and without disease progression, after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 6-89 months). LOT is an uncommon eosinophilic renal neoplasm with unique morphological and characteristic immunophenotypic features, and may represent an emerging separate renal entity characterized by mutations in the TSC/MTOR pathway.",

    "title": "Long-Term Everolimus Treatment in Individuals With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: A Review of the Current Literature.",
    "issue": "53(1)",
    "pages": "23-30",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disease usually caused by mutations to either TSC1 or TSC2, where its gene products are involved in the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Under normal cellular conditions, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and proliferation in response to signals from nutrients or growth factors, but loss of TSC1 or TSC2 leads to overactivation of mTOR and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor approved for use in a number of indications where mTOR overactivation is implicated, including tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n\nMETHODS AND PATIENTS\nWe conducted a literature search of PubMed to identify published articles about the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe short-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials, and open-label extension studies are ongoing to monitor long-term effects, including safety. Examples of regrowth following discontinuation of mTOR inhibitors suggest that everolimus needs to be given indefinitely to maintain suppression of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and other tuberous sclerosis complex-associated disease manifestations. No additional safety concerns have been reported to date with long-term administration of everolimus, but published long-term data (>1 year treatment) are currently limited to a small open-label trial and case reports for this relatively rare condition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFrom the limited data available, long-term administration of everolimus appears feasible with few safety concerns beyond those associated with short-term use. Further investigation is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.",

The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products form a functional complex and inhibit phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. These functions of TSC1/TSC2 are likely mediated by mTOR. Here we report that TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) toward Rheb, a Ras family GTPase. Rheb stimulates phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. This function of Rheb is blocked by rapamycin and dominant-negative mTOR. Rheb stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR and plays an essential role in regulation of S6K and 4EBP1 in response to nutrients and cellular energy status. Our data demonstrate that Rheb acts downstream of TSC1/TSC2 and upstream of mTOR to regulate cell growth.",

    "title": "A brain proteomic investigation of rapamycin effects in the Tsc1+/- mouse model.",
    "issue": "8()",
    "pages": "41",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare monogenic disorder characterized by benign tumors in multiple organs as well as a high prevalence of epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism. TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Heterozygocity induces hyperactivation of mTOR which can be inhibited by mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, which have proven efficacy in the treatment of TSC-associated symptoms. The aim of the present study was (1) to identify molecular changes associated with social and cognitive deficits in the brain tissue of Tsc1+/- mice and (2) to investigate the molecular effects of rapamycin treatment, which has been shown to ameliorate genotype-related behavioural deficits.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMolecular alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of Tsc1+/- and control mice, with or without rapamycin treatment, were investigated. A quantitative mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic approach (LC-MSE) was employed as an unbiased method to detect changes in protein levels. Changes identified in the initial profiling stage were validated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Protein Set Enrichment Analysis was employed to identify dysregulated pathways.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLC-MSE analysis of Tsc1+/- mice and controls (n = 30) identified 51 proteins changed in frontal cortex and 108 in the hippocampus. Bioinformatic analysis combined with targeted proteomic validation revealed several dysregulated molecular pathways. Using targeted assays, proteomic alterations in the hippocampus validated the pathways \"myelination\", \"dendrite,\" and \"oxidative stress\", an upregulation of ribosomal proteins and the mTOR kinase. LC-MSE analysis was also employed on Tsc1+/- and wildtype mice (n = 34) treated with rapamycin or vehicle. Rapamycin treatment exerted a stronger proteomic effect in Tsc1 mice with significant changes (mainly decreased expression) in 231 and 106 proteins, respectively. The cellular pathways \"oxidative stress\" and \"apoptosis\" were found to be affected in Tsc1+/- mice and the cellular compartments \"myelin sheet\" and \"neurofilaments\" were affected by rapamycin treatment. Thirty-three proteins which were altered in Tsc1+/- mice were normalized following rapamycin treatment, amongst them oxidative stress related proteins, myelin-specific and ribosomal proteins.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMolecular changes in the Tsc1+/- mouse brain were more prominent in the hippocampus compared to the frontal cortex. Pathways linked to myelination and oxidative stress response were prominently affected and, at least in part, normalized following rapamycin treatment. The results could aid in the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of cognitive, social and psychiatric symptoms in autism spectrum disorders. Similar pathways have also been implicated in other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and could imply similar disease processes. Thus, the potential efficacy of mTOR inhibitors warrants further investigation not only for autism spectrum disorders but also for other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "issue": "6(6)",
    "pages": "649-59",
    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have shown that diabetes mellitus is associated positively with increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and recent meta-analysis studies showed that metformin, reduces the risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). We tested the effects of metformin on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and their progression to PDAC in p48Cre/+.LSL-KrasG12D/+ transgenic mice. Mice fed control diet showed 80% and 62% incidence of PDAC in males and females, respectively. Male mice showed 20% and 26%, and female mice showed 7% and 0% PDAC incidence with 1000- and 2000-ppm metformin treatments, respectively. Both doses of metformin decreased pancreatic tumor weights by 34% to 49% (P < 0.03-0.001). The drug treatment caused suppression of PanIN 3 (carcinoma in situ) lesions by 28% to 39% (P < .002) and significant inhibition of carcinoma spread in the pancreas. The pancreatic tissue and/or serum of mice fed metformin showed a significant inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pErk), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) with an increase in phosphorylated 5' adenosine monophosphate kinase (pAMPK), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1, TSC2), C-protein and an autophagy related protein 2 (ATG2). The cancer stem cell (CSC) markers were significantly decreased (P < 0.04-0.0002) in the pancreatic tissue. These results suggest that biologic effects of metformin are mediated through decreased CSC markers cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44 and CD133), aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1), and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) and modulation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Our preclinical data indicate that metformin has significant potential for use in clinical trials for PC chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused by germline mutations in the FLCN gene that predisposes patients to develop renal tumors. Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is not a renal tumor sub-type associated with BHD. AML is, however, a common phenotypic manifestation of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) syndrome caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. Previous case reports of renal AML in patients with BHD have speculated on the molecular and clinical overlap of these two syndromes as a result of described involvement of the gene products in the mTOR pathway. Our recent work provided a new molecular link between these two syndromes by identifying FLCN and Tsc2 as clients of the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Folliculin interacting proteins FNIP1/2 and Tsc1 are important for FLCN and Tsc2 stability as new Hsp90 co-chaperones. Here we present a case of sporadic AML as a result of somatic Tsc1/2 loss in a patient with BHD. We further demonstrate that FNIP1 and Tsc1 are capable of compensating for each other in the chaperoning of mutated FLCN tumor suppressor. Our findings demonstrate interconnectivity and compensatory mechanisms between the BHD and TSC pathways.",

    "pages": "91-118",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic condition caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Phenotypically, this leads to aberrant cell growth and the formation of benign tumors called hamartomas in multiple organs. Understanding the mechanisms of pathology that are caused through the presence of disease causing mutations is a real hurdle for many rare genetic disorders; a limiting factor that restricts knowledge of the disease and any hope of a future cure. Through the discovery of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes and the signaling pathways responsible for the pathology of TSC, a new drug target called mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was discovered. Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, is now the only pharmacological therapy approved for the treatment of TSC. This chapter summarizes the success story of TSC and explores the future possibilities of finding a cure.",

    "abstract": "The TSC1-TSC2/Rheb/Raptor-mTOR/S6K1 cell growth cassette has recently been shown to regulate cell autonomous insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) sensitivity by transducing a negative feedback signal that targets insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 and -2). Using two cell culture models of the familial hamartoma syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, we show here that Raptor-mTOR and S6K1 are required for phosphorylation of IRS1 at a subset of serine residues frequently associated with insulin resistance, including S307, S312, S527, S616, and S636 (of human IRS1). Using loss- and gain-of-function S6K1 constructs, we demonstrate a requirement for the catalytic activity of S6K1 in both direct and indirect regulation of IRS1 serine phosphorylation. S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1 in vitro on multiple residues showing strong preference for RXRXXS/T over S/T,P sites. IRS1 is preferentially depleted from the high-speed pellet fraction in TSC1/2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts or in HEK293/293T cells overexpressing Rheb. These studies suggest that, through serine phosphorylation, Raptor-mTOR and S6K1 cell autonomously promote the depletion of IRS1 from specific intracellular pools in pathological states of insulin and IGF-I resistance and thus potentially in lesions associated with tuberous sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The mTOR pathway orchestrates diverse physiological processes, including T cell functions and fate decisions; however, the regulation of mTOR-dependent T cell differentiation remains elusive. In this issue, Park et al. examine the role of TSC1, an mTOR signaling regulator, in T cell differentiation and the balance between T cell-mediated immunity and tolerance. They found that enhanced mTOR activity in Tsc1-deficient T cells promotes Th1 and Th17 differentiation, leading to increased intestinal inflammation in murine colitis. Tsc1-deficient Tregs had impaired suppressive activity in inflammatory conditions. These defects were associated with the acquisition of effector-like phenotypes and could be further exacerbated by concomitant loss of transcription factor Foxo3. This study highlights that TSC1-mediated control of mTOR activity impinges on the balance between immunity and tolerance by dictating effector and regulatory T cell responses.",

    "pages": "226-42",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain, heart, skin, kidney, and lung, by formation of benign hamartomas. It can be associated with autism, epilepsy, and other neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities. The incidence of TSC is approximately 1 in 6,000 live births, but it may be underdiagnosed. Mutations to either the TSC1 (coding for hamartin) or TSC2 (coding for tuberin) genes are present in 85% of patients with TSC. The TSC1/TSC2 protein dimer complex is a crucial inhibitory element in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation. The manifestations of TSC usually require management over the entire life of the patient. Until recently, there were few options, other than surgical removal, for treating the symptoms of TSC related to growth of hamartomas. Increased understanding of the genetic cause of the disease and the underlying dysregulation of the mTOR pathway has led to clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors including sirolimus and everolimus. This article will review the various manifestations of TSC and describe treatment strategies, recommendations for surveillance, and use of mTOR inhibitors in their management.",

    "abstract": "Neurological symptoms in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and associated brain lesions are thought to arise from abnormal embryonic neurogenesis due to inherited mutations in Tsc1 or Tsc2. Neurogenesis persists postnatally in the human subventricular zone (SVZ) where slow-growing tumors containing Tsc-mutant cells are generated in TSC patients. However, whether Tsc-mutant neurons from the postnatal SVZ contribute to brain lesions and abnormal circuit remodeling in forebrain structures remain unexplored. Here, we report the formation of olfactory lesions following conditional genetic Tsc1 deletion in the postnatal SVZ using transgenic mice or targeted single-cell electroporation. These lesions include migratory heterotopias and olfactory micronodules containing neurons with a hypertrophic dendritic tree. Most significantly, our data identify migrating glial and neuronal precursors that are re-routed and infiltrate forebrain structures (e.g. cortex) and become glia and neurons. These data show that Tsc1-mutant cells from the neonatal and juvenile SVZ generate brain lesions and structural abnormalities, which would not be visible using conventional non-invasive imaging. These findings also raise the hypothesis that micronodules and the persistent infiltration of cells to forebrain structures may contribute to network malfunction leading to progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms in TSC.",

    "abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) in the liver promotes gluconeogenesis and glucose intolerance. We asked whether this could be attributed to aberrant expression of small RNAs. We performed small-RNA sequencing on liver of Tsc1-knockout mice, and found that miRNAs of the delta-like homolog 1 (Dlk1)-deiodinase iodothyronine type III (Dio3) locus are up-regulated in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Sustained mTORC1 signaling during development prevented CpG methylation and silencing of the Dlk1-Dio3 locus, thereby increasing miRNA transcription. Deletion of miRNAs encoded by the Dlk1-Dio3 locus reduced gluconeogenesis, glucose intolerance, and fasting blood glucose levels. Thus, miRNAs contribute to the metabolic effects observed upon loss of TSC1 and hyperactivation of mTORC1 in the liver. Furthermore, we show that miRNA is a downstream effector of hyperactive mTORC1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disease, with variable expressivity and multisystemic involvement, which is characterised by the growth of benign tumours called hamartomas. The organs that are most commonly affected are the brain, skin, kidneys, eyes, heart and lungs. Of all the children with this disease, 85% present neurological manifestations that, due to their severity, are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. The most significant neurological manifestations are epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders and mental retardation. It has been shown that in tuberous sclerosis complex the genes TSC1 and TSC2 alter the mTOR enzyme cascade, which sets off inhibition of this pathway. The possibility of resorting to treatments applied at the origin, thus inhibiting this pathway, is currently being evaluated.",

    "pages": "4985-4995",
    "abstract": "The mTOR signaling pathway regulates protein synthesis and diverse aspects of neuronal morphology that are important for brain development and function. To identify proteins controlled translationally by mTOR signaling, we performed ribosome profiling analyses in mouse cortical neurons and embryonic stem cells upon acute mTOR inhibition. Among proteins whose translation was significantly affected by mTOR inhibition selectively in neurons, we identified the cytoskeletal regulator protein palladin, which is localized within the cell body and axons in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of palladin eliminated supernumerary axons induced by suppression of the tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC1 in neurons, demonstrating that palladin regulates neuronal morphogenesis downstream of mTOR signaling. Our findings provide novel insights into an mTOR-dependent mechanism that controls neuronal morphogenesis through translational regulation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study reports the discovery of neuron-specific protein translational responses to alterations of mTOR activity. By using ribosome profiling analysis, which can reveal the location and quantity of translating ribosomes on mRNAs, multiple aspects of protein translation were quantitatively analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cells and cortical neurons upon acute mTOR inhibition. Neurons displayed distinct patterns of ribosome occupancy for each codon and ribosome stalling during translation at specific positions of mRNAs. Importantly, the cytoskeletal regulator palladin was identified as a translational target protein of mTOR signaling in neurons. Palladin operates downstream of mTOR to modulate axon morphogenesis. This study identifies a novel mechanism of neuronal morphogenesis regulated by mTOR signaling through control of translation of the key protein palladin.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition characterized by the occurrence of hamartomatous wounds stemming from the dysfunction of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We investigated the clinical phenotypes and genetic variants in 243 unrelated probands and their families in China. Exome sequencing, targeted sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed in 174 children with TSC, among whom 31 (17.82%) patients/families were identified as having pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the TSC1 gene, 120 (68.97%) as having pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the TSC2 gene and 23 (13.21%) as having no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified (NMI). In the 31 patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic TSC1 variants, 10 novel variants were detected among 26 different variants. In all 120 patients with TSC2 variants, 39 novel variants were found among a total of 107 different variants. We compared the phenotypes of the individuals with TSC1 pathogenic variants, TSC2 pathogenic variants and NMI. Patients with TSC2 variants were first diagnosed at a younger age (p = 0.003) and had more retinal hamartomas (p = 0.003) and facial angiofibromas (p = 0.027) (age ≥ 3 years) than individuals with TSC1 variants. Compared with individuals with TSC1/TSC2 pathogenic variants, NMI individuals had fewer cortical tubers (p = 0.003). Compared with individuals with TSC1 pathogenic variants, NMI patients had more retinal hamartomas (p = 0.035), and compared with individuals with TSC2 pathogenic variants, they had less epilepsy (p = 0.003) and fewer subependymal nodules (SENs) (p = 0.004).",

    "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the most frequent tumor of the urinary tract and represents the fifth cause of death by cancer worldwide. The current first line chemotherapy is a combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine with median survival not exceeding 15months. Vinflunine is the only drug approved by EMEA as second-line treatment and few progresses have been made for the past 20years to increase the survival of metastatic patients, especially those who are not eligible for cisplatin-based regimen. The recent studies characterizing the genetic background of urothelial cancers of the bladder, revealed chromosomal alterations that are not seen at the same level in other types of cancers. This is especially the case for mutations of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that occupies a major place in the etiology of these tumors. Here, we describe the mutations leading to constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and discuss the potential use of the different classes of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Despite the recent pivotal study evidencing specific mutations of TSC1 in bladder cancer patients responding to everolimus and the encouraging results obtained with other derivatives than rapalogs, few clinical trials are ongoing in bladder cancers. Because of the genetic complexity of these tumors, the cross-talks of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with other pathways, and the small number of eligible patients, it will be of utmost importance to carefully choose the drugs or drug combinations to be further tested in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nRapalogs are allosteric mTOR inhibitors and approved agents for advanced kidney cancer. Reports of clonal heterogeneity in this disease challenge the concept of targeted monotherapy, yet a small subset of patients derives extended benefit. Our aim was to analyze such outliers and explore the genomic background of extreme rapalog sensitivity in the context of intratumor heterogeneity.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWe analyzed archived tumor tissue of 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma, who previously achieved durable disease control with rapalogs (median duration, 28 months). DNA was extracted from spatially separate areas of primary tumors and metastases. Custom target capture and ultradeep sequencing was used to identify alterations across 230 target genes. Whole-exome sequence analysis was added to investigate genes beyond this original target list.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive long-term responders contributed 14 specimens to explore clonal heterogeneity. Genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were detected in 11 of 14 specimens, offering plausible explanation for exceptional treatment response through alterations in two genes (TSC1 and MTOR). In two subjects, distinct yet functionally convergent alterations activated the mTOR pathway in spatially separate sites. In 1 patient, concurrent genomic events occurred in two separate pathway components across different tumor regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnalysis of outlier cases can facilitate identification of potential biomarkers for targeted agents, and we implicate two genes as candidates for further study in this class of drugs. The previously reported phenomenon of clonal convergence can occur within a targetable pathway which might have implications for biomarker development beyond this disease and this class of agents.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or 2 (TSC1 or TSC2) leads to the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Hyperactivated mTORC1 plays a critical role in tumor growth, but the underlying mechanism is still not completely elucidated. Here, by analyzing Tsc1- or Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, rat Tsc2-null ELT3 cells, and human cancer cells, we present evidence for the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a downstream target of mTORC1 in tumor growth. We show that mTORC1 leads to increased EGFR expression through upregulation of runt-related transcriptional factor 1 (RUNX1). Knockdown of EGFR impairs proliferation and tumoral growth of Tsc-deficient cells, while overexpression of EGFR promotes the proliferation of the control cells. Moreover, the mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to be positively correlated with EGFR in human cancers. In addition, we demonstrated that EGFR enhances cell growth through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We conclude that activation of the RUNX1/EGFR/STAT3 signaling pathway contributes to tumorigenesis caused by hyperactivated mTORC1 and should be targeted for the treatment of mTORC1-related tumors, particularly TSC.",

    "abstract": "The two-hit hypothesis presented by Knudson in 1971 explains the development of tumours deficient in anti-oncogenes. Hamartomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis usually fit into this model, the first hit is a congenital lesion of either of the tuberous sclerosis genes (TSC1 or TSC2), and the second hit is loss of heterozygosity of this gene. Although this mechanism is true for most tumours associated with tuberous sclerosis, only 30-60% of brain and cardiac tumours show loss of heterozygosity--the remaining tumours develop despite the presence of an intact allele. Tumours in which loss of heterozygosity is rare, such as subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, might all share a common feature that mimics loss of heterozygosity either by inactivation of the TSC complex or by direct activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or its downstream targets. Because phosphorylation of the TSC complex can inactivate it, expression and activation patterns of protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), two potent protein kinases that are activators of the mTOR pathway, have been implicated. AKT activation is detected only in few samples, whereas ERK is hyperactive in all subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas. We postulate that ERK activation consistently detected in different tuberous-sclerosis-associated tumours is a molecular trigger for the development of these neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis, neurological genetic disorder characterized by the formation of benign tumors or hamartomas in multiple organ systems, is recently getting much attention. Numerous papers describe still-not-fully-explained pathogenesis of the disease. Studies on tuberous sclerosis allowed identification of two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2, encoding proteins implicated in the disease: hamartin and tuberin, respectively. The importance of these proteins is confirmed by their ubiquitous character and by the fact that TSC1/TSC2 complex is involved in the regulation of the activity of mTOR, a master controller of protein translation. Thus, the meaning of hamartin and tuberin goes far beyond tuberous sclerosis. As far as the influence of the TSC1/TSC2 complex on protein translation is well described in numerous reviews, little attention is drawn to the recently discovered role of the TSC1/TSC2 complex in gene transcription via the WNT signaling pathway. The present paper focuses on recent developments documenting the role of hamartin and tuberin in the WNT pathway.",

    "abstract": "The underlying molecular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) in humans and many strains of mice have not been fully characterized. This common age-related disorder is assumed to be closely associated with oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 signaling is highly and specifically activated in the cochlear neurosensory epithelium (NSE) in aging mice, and rapamycin injection prevents ARHL. To further examine the specific role of mTORC1 signaling in ARHL, we generated murine models with NSE-specific deletions of Raptor or Tsc1, regulators of mTORC1 signaling. Raptor-cKO mice developed hearing loss considerably more slowly than WT littermates. Conversely, Tsc1 loss led to the early-onset death of cochlear hair cells and consequently accelerated hearing loss. Tsc1-cKO cochleae showed features of oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defenses. Treatment with rapamycin and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine rescued Tsc1-cKO hair cells from injury in vivo. In addition, we identified the peroxisome as the initial signaling organelle involved in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling in cochlear hair cells. In summary, our findings identify overactive mTORC1 signaling as one of the critical causes of ARHL and suggest that reduction of mTORC1 activity in cochlear hair cells may be a potential strategy to prevent ARHL.",

    "issue": "19(3)",
    "pages": "501-10",
    "abstract": "Suppression of anoikis after detachment of cancer cells from the extracellular matrix is a key step during metastasis. Here we show that, after detachment, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed by K-Ras(V12) or ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) activate a transcriptional response overrepresented by genes related to bioenergetic stress and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) energy-sensing pathway. Accordingly, AMPK is activated in both transformed and non-transformed cells after detachment, and AMPK deficiency restores anoikis to transformed MEFs. However, AMPK activation represses the mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) pathway only in transformed cells, suggesting a key role for AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition in the suppression of anoikis. Consistent with this, AMPK-/- MEFs transformed by EN or K-Ras show sustained mTORC1 activation after detachment and fail to suppress anoikis. Transformed TSC1-/- MEFs, which are incapable of suppressing mTORC1, also undergo anoikis after detachment, which is reversed by mTORC1 inhibitors. Furthermore, transformed AMPK-/- and TSC1-/- MEFs both have higher total protein synthesis rates than wild-type controls, and translation inhibition using cycloheximide partially restores their anoikis resistance, indicating a mechanism whereby mTORC1 inhibition suppresses anoikis. Finally, breast carcinoma cell lines show similar detachment-induced AMPK/mTORC1 activation and restoration of anoikis by AMPK inhibition. Our data implicate AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition and suppression of protein synthesis as a means for bioenergetic conservation during detachment, thus promoting anoikis resistance.",

We developed a murine model of Tsc1 disease by gene targeting. Tsc1 null embryos die at mid-gestation from a failure of liver development. Tsc1 heterozygotes develop kidney cystadenomas and liver hemangiomas at high frequency, but the incidence of kidney tumors is somewhat lower than in Tsc2 heterozygote mice. Liver hemangiomas were more common, more severe and caused higher mortality in female than in male Tsc1 heterozygotes. Tsc1 null embryo fibroblast lines have persistent phosphorylation of the p70S6K (S6K) and its substrate S6, that is sensitive to treatment with rapamycin, indicating constitutive activation of the mTOR-S6K pathway due to loss of the Tsc1 protein, hamartin. Hyperphosphorylation of S6 is also seen in kidney tumors in the heterozygote mice, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may have benefit in control of TSC hamartomas.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical significance of hepatic angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 187 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The prevalence, progression, and potential relationship between liver lesions and other clinical findings, including genetic associations, were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-eight of 187 patients (14.9%) had hepatic lesions. There was a predominance of female over male patients in individuals with liver lesions (17 versus 11), with statistical significance in patients under five years of age (P < 0.05). All individuals having hepatic lesions who also had available genetic testing data (n = 20) were diagnosed with a TSC2 gene mutation. All patients with liver lesions had coexisting renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) (P < 0.05). The age of onset of renal lesions was lower and their prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver involvement (P < 0.05). In most instances, hepatic lesions measured several millimeters in diameter and were clinically asymptomatic. Progressive lesion growth was documented in six individuals but with no clinical consequences to date.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study confirms the association of hepatic lesions with TSC2 mutations, a common origin of liver and renal AMLs, as well as the predominance of female patients in this group. Hepatic AMLs are relatively common but mostly benign lesions.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinical evaluation of everolimus for seizure reduction in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a disease with overactivated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, has demonstrated the therapeutic value of mTOR inhibitors for central nervous system (CNS) indications. Given that everolimus is an incomplete inhibitor of the mTOR function, we sought to develop a new mTOR inhibitor that has improved properties and is suitable for CNS disorders. Starting from an in-house purine-based compound, optimization of the physicochemical properties of a thiazolopyrimidine series led to the discovery of the small molecule 7, a potent and selective brain-penetrant ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor. In neuronal cell-based models of mTOR hyperactivity, 7 corrected the mTOR pathway activity and the resulting neuronal overgrowth phenotype. The new mTOR inhibitor 7 showed good brain exposure and significantly improved the survival rate of mice with neuronal-specific ablation of the Tsc1 gene. These results demonstrate the potential utility of this tool compound to test therapeutic hypotheses that depend on mTOR hyperactivity in the CNS.",

    "issue": "13(15)",
    "pages": "1259-68",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that occurs through the loss of heterozygosity of either TSC1 or TSC2, which encode Hamartin or Tuberin, respectively. Tuberin and Hamartin form a tumor suppressor heterodimer that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) nutrient signaling input, but how this occurs is unclear.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe show that the small G protein Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) is a molecular target of TSC1/TSC2 that regulates mTOR signaling. Overexpression of Rheb activates 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) but not p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) or Akt. Furthermore, Rheb induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and causes 4E-BP1 to dissociate from eIF4E. This dissociation is completely sensitive to rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) but not wortmannin (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor). Rheb also activates S6K1 during amino acid insufficiency via a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism, suggesting that Rheb participates in nutrient signaling through mTOR. Moreover, Rheb does not activate a S6K1 mutant that is unresponsive to mTOR-mediated signals, confirming that Rheb functions upstream of mTOR. Overexpression of the Tuberin-Hamartin heterodimer inhibits Rheb-mediated S6K1 activation, suggesting that Tuberin functions as a Rheb GTPase activating protein (GAP). Supporting this notion, TSC patient-derived Tuberin GAP domain mutants were unable to inactivate Rheb in vivo. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that Tuberin, when associated with Hamartin, acts as a Rheb GTPase-activating protein. Finally, we show that membrane localization of Rheb is important for its biological activity because a farnesylation-defective mutant of Rheb stimulated S6K1 activation less efficiently.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe show that Rheb acts as a novel mediator of the nutrient signaling input to mTOR and is the molecular target of TSC1 and TSC2 within mammalian cells.",

    "issue": "21(2)",
    "pages": "230-238",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and characterized by development of tumors in multiple organs including the kidneys. TSC-associated tumors exhibit somatic loss of the second allele of the TSC genes, leading to aberrant activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) causes addiction to glucose and glutamine in Tsc1-/-or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Blocking of glutamine anaplerosis in combination with glycolytic inhibition causes significant cell death in Tsc2-/- but not Tsc2+/+ MEFs. In this study, we tested efficacy of dual inhibition of glycolysis with 3-BrPA and glutaminolysis with CB-839 for renal tumors in Tsc2+/- mice. Following 2 months of treatment of Tsc2+/- mice from the age of 12 months, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 significantly reduced overall size and cellular areas of all renal lesions (cystic/papillary adenomas and solid carcinomas), but neither alone did. Combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 inhibited mTORC1 and the proliferation of tumor cells but did not increase apoptosis. However, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 was not as efficacious as rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 for renal lesions of Tsc2+/- mice. Consistently, rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 had stronger inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and proliferation of tumor cells than combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839. We conclude that combination of 3-BRPA and CB-839 may not offer a better therapeutic strategy than rapamycin for TSC-associated tumors.",

    "issue": "13(5)",
    "pages": "640-50",
    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which serves as a key regulator of inflammatory responses after bacterial stimulation in monocytes, macrophages, and primary dendritic cells. Previous studies have shown that TSC1 knockout (KO) macrophages produced increased inflammatory responses including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-12 to pro-inflammatory stimuli, but whether and how TSC1 regulates pro-IL-1β expression remains unclear. Here using a mouse model in which myeloid lineage-specific deletion of TSC1 leads to constitutive mTORC1 activation, we found that TSC1 deficiency resulted in impaired expression of pro-IL-1β in macrophages following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Such decreased pro-IL-1β expression in TSC1 KO macrophages was rescued by reducing mTORC1 activity with rapamycin or deletion of mTOR. Rictor deficiency has no detectable effect on pro-IL-1β synthesis, suggesting that TSC1 positively controls pro-IL-1β expression through mTORC1 pathway. Moreover, mechanism studies suggest that mTORC1-mediated downregulation of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) critically contributes to the defective pro-IL-1β expression. Overall, these findings highlight a critical role of TSC1 in regulating innate immunity by control of the mTOR1-C/EBPβ pathway.",

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency (ID) is one of the most commonly known forms of nutritional deficiencies. Low body iron is thought to induce neurologic defects but may also play a protective role against cancer development by cell growth arrest. Thus, ID may affect cellular pathways controlling cell growth and proliferation, the mechanism of which is still not fully understood. The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt and its downstream target, the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and survival. Therefore, we hypothesized that Akt/mTOR pathway could be influenced by ID. Three-week-old male Wistar-strain rats were divided into 3 groups and the 2 groups had free access to a control diet (C group) or an iron-deficient diet (D group). The third group (PF group) were pair-fed the control diet to the mean intake of the D group. After 4 weeks, rats were killed and their brains were sampled. In separate experiments, COS-1 cells were cultured with or without the iron chelator deferoxamine. Western blots of brain samples and COS-1 lysates were used to analyze the expression and phosphorylation state of Akt, TSC2, mTOR, and S6 kinase proteins implicated in the Akt/mTOR pathway. Using 2 different ID models, we show for the first time that iron deficiency depresses Akt activity in rats and in COS-1 cells, leading to a decrease in mTOR activity.",

    "issue": "9()",
    "pages": "48",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), encoded by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, form a tumor-suppressor heterodimer which is implicated in PI3K-Akt signaling and acts as a functional inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Dysregulation of mTOR has been assigned to carcinogenesis and thus may be involved in cancer development. We have addressed the role of hamartin, phospho-tuberin (p-TSC2) and phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) in a series of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected 166 NSCLC and SCLC samples for immunohistochemical studies and performed western blot analyses in NSCLC and SCLC cell lines as well as comparative analyses with EGFR phosphorylation and downstream effectors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn cell lines we found an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-mTOR expression. In surgical specimens cytoplasmic hamartin expression was observed in more than 50% of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to 14% of SCLC. P-mTOR and p-TSC2 staining was found in a minority of cases.There was a significant correlation between p-EGFR Tyr-1068, p-EGFR Tyr-992 and hamartin, and also between p-mTOR and p-EGFR Tyr-1173 in AC. In SCC an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-EGFR Tyr-992 was detected. Phosphorylation of TSC2 was associated with expression of MAP-Kinase. Hamartin, p-TSC2 and p-mTOR expression was not dependant of the EGFR mutation status. Hamartin expression is associated with poorer survival in SCC and SCLC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings confirm the inhibitory role of the tuberous sclerosis complex for mTOR activation in lung cancer cell lines. These results reveal hamartin expression in a substantial subset of NSCLC and SCLC specimens, which may be due to EGFR signaling but is not dependant on EGFR mutations. Our data provide evidence for a functional role of the tuberous sclerosis complex in lung cancer.\n\n\nVIRTUAL SLIDES\nThe virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/9274845161175223.",

    "pages": "e41931",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major cause of cancer-related death in Southeast Asia, is frequently associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV X protein (HBx), encoded by a viral non-structural gene, is a multifunctional regulator in HBV-associated tumor development. We investigated novel signaling pathways underlying HBx-induced liver tumorigenesis and found that the signaling pathway involving IκB kinase β (IKKβ), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream effector S6 kinase (S6K1), was upregulated when HBx was overexpressed in hepatoma cells. HBx-induced S6K1 activation was reversed by IKKβ inhibitor Bay 11-7082 or silencing IKKβ expression using siRNA. HBx upregulated cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, and these HBx-upregulated phenotypes were abolished by treatment with IKKβ inhibitor Bay 11-7082 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The association of HBx-modulated IKKβ/mTOR/S6K1 signaling with liver tumorigenesis was verified in a HBx transgenic mouse model in which pIKKβ, pS6K1, and VEGF expression was found to be higher in cancerous than non-cancerous liver tissues. Furthermore, we also found that pIKKβ levels were strongly correlated with pTSC1 and pS6K1 levels in HBV-associated hepatoma tissue specimens taken from 95 patients, and that higher pIKKβ, pTSC1, and pS6K1 levels were correlated with a poor prognosis in these patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that HBx deregulates TSC1/mTOR signaling through IKKβ, which is crucially linked to HBV-associated HCC development.",

    "issue": "12(2)",
    "pages": "e6920",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with a high prevalence of associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The pathophysiology of TSC mainly involves the hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) induced by TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin) heterozygosity. The mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, is a therapeutic target for TSC-related ASD. The efficacy of everolimus may be affected by iron and copper neurotransmission and oxidant-antioxidant systems. Creatine has an antioxidant activity related to the cytoprotective paradigm. Additionally, TSC-related epileptic activity may influence the development of autistic symptoms. This case series examined the efficacy of everolimus in relation to the serum levels of the iron mediator (transferrin (Tf)), the copper mediator (ceruloplasmin (Cp)), the oxidant marker (oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)), the antioxidant marker (total antioxidant power (TAP)), and creatine in four cases of TSC accompanied with autism. Everolimus improved autistic symptoms with increased serum Cp and Tf levels in all four cases. Serum TAP and creatine levels showed positive correlations with decreased total Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, respectively. As everolimus regulates iron homeostasis and increased copper levels suppress mTOR signaling, everolimus improved autism symptoms with increased serum levels of Cp and Tf via homeostatic control of mTOR activity, accompanied with the considerable overlap of oxidant-antioxidant systems, such as TAP and creatine. Everolimus had no effect on TSC-related epileptiform discharges; thus, the autistic symptoms and epileptic activity may be two independent end results of a common central nervous system including mTOR hyperactivity.",

    "title": "Activation of mTORC1 in collecting ducts causes hyperkalemia.",
    "issue": "25(3)",
    "pages": "534-45",
    "abstract": "Mutation of TSC (encoding tuberous sclerosis complex protein) and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several renal diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease. However, the role of mTOR in renal potassium excretion and hyperkalemia is not known. We showed that mice with collecting-duct (CD)-specific ablation of TSC1 (CDTsc1KO) had greater mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation in the CD and demonstrated features of pseudohypoaldosteronism, including hyperkalemia, hyperaldosteronism, and metabolic acidosis. mTORC1 activation caused endoplasmic reticulum stress, columnar cell lesions, and dedifferentiation of CD cells with loss of aquaporin-2 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like phenotypes. Of note, mTORC1 activation also reduced the expression of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, a crucial regulator of potassium homeostasis in the kidney, and decreased the expression and/or activity of epithelial sodium channel-α, renal outer medullary potassium channel, and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase in the CD, which probably contributed to the aldosterone resistance and hyperkalemia in these mice. Rapamycin restored these phenotypic changes. Overall, this study identifies a novel function of mTORC1 in regulating potassium homeostasis and demonstrates that loss of TSC1 and activation of mTORC1 results in dedifferentiation and dysfunction of the CD and causes hyperkalemia. The CDTsc1KO mice provide a novel model for hyperkalemia induced exclusively by dysfunction of the CD.",

    "issue": "8()",
    "pages": "616747",
    "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is considered as the final pathway of all types of kidney diseases, which can lead to the progressive loss of kidney functions and eventually renal failure. The mechanisms behind are diversified, in which the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one of the most important regulatory pathways that accounts for the disease. Several processes that are regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, are tightly associated with renal fibrosis. In this study, we have reported that the expression of tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein 6, a member of TRIM family protein, was highly expressed in renal fibrosis patients and positively correlated with the severity of renal fibrosis. In our established in vitro and in vivo renal fibrosis models, its expression was upregulated by the Angiotensin II-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p50 and p65. In HK2 cells, the expression of TRIM6 promoted the ubiquitination of tuberous sclerosis proteins (TSC) 1 and 2, two negative regulators of the mTORC1 pathway. Moreover, the knockdown of TRIM6 was found efficient for alleviating renal fibrosis and inhibiting the downstream processes of EMT and ER in both HK2 cells and 5/6-nephrectomized rats. Clinically, the level of TRIM6, TSC1/2, and NF-κB p50 was found closely related to renal fibrosis. As a result, we have presented the first study on the role of TRIM6 in the mTORC1 pathway in renal fibrosis models and our findings suggested that TRIM6 may be a potential target for the treatment of renal fibrosis.",

    "pages": "459-461",
    "abstract": "SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is a macroautophagy/autophagy receptor protein that is degraded by selective autophagy. Intracellular accumulation of SQSTM1 activates multiple cell survival signaling pathways including NFΚB/NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) and NFE2L2/Nrf2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2). Both SQSTM1 and NFE2L2 have been considered as oncogenic, and increased accumulation of SQSTM1 and NFE2L2 activation have been frequently observed in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. In a recent study, we found that deletion of Sqstm1 improved hepatic metabolic reprogramming and cell repopulation resulting in the attenuation of liver injury in mice with liver-specific deletion of Atg5 and Tsc1 that have defective hepatic autophagy and persistent MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) activation. To our surprise, hepatocytic deletion of Sqstm1 promotes liver tumorigenesis in liver-specific atg5 and tsc1 double-knockout mice. Overall, these findings reveal a complex interplay among autophagy, SQSTM1 and MTORC1 and their differential roles either as oncogenic or tumor suppressor in liver tumorigenesis depending on the disease stage and context.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells play critical roles in allergic disorders and asthma. The importance of tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2-mammalian target of rapamycin (TSC1/2-mTOR) signaling in mast cells is unknown. Here, we report that TSC1 is a critical regulator for mTOR signaling in mast cells downstream of FcεRI and c-Kit, and differentially controls mast cell degranulation and cytokine production. TSC1-deficiency results in impaired mast cell degranulation, but enhanced cytokine production in vitro and in vivo after FcεRI engagement. Furthermore, TSC1 is critical for mast cell survival through multiple pathways of apoptosis including the down-regulation of p53, miR-34a, reactive oxygen species, and the up-regulation of Bcl-2. Together, these findings reveal that TSC1 is a critical regulator of mast cell activation and survival, suggesting the manipulation of the TSC1/2-mTOR pathway as a therapeutic strategy for mast cell-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder that results from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and is associated with hamartomas in several organs, including subependymal giant cell tumors. The neurological manifestations of TSC are particularly challenging and include infantile spasms, intractable epilepsy, cognitive disabilities, and autism. The TSC1- and TSC2-encoded proteins modulate cell function via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and are key factors in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. The mTOR pathway provides an intersection for an intricate network of protein cascades that respond to cellular nutrition, energy levels, and growth factor stimulation. In the brain, TSC1 and TSC2 have been implicated in cell body size, dendritic arborization, axonal outgrowth and targeting, neuronal migration, cortical lamination, and spine formation. The mTOR pathway represents a logical candidate for drug targeting, because mTOR regulates multiple cellular functions that may contribute to epileptogenesis, including protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, and synaptic plasticity. Antagonism of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin and related compounds may provide new therapeutic options for TSC patients.",

Although rodent models bearing a germline mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene have been generated, they do not develop pathogenic lesions matching those seen in patients with TSC because of the significant differences between mice and humans, highlighting the need for an improved large animal model of TSC. Here, we successfully generate monoallelic TSC1-modified Bama miniature pigs using the CRISPR/Cas9 system along with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology. The expression of phosphorylated target ribosomal protein S6 is significantly enhanced in the piglets, indicating that disruption of a TSC1 allele activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Notably, differing from the mouse TSC models reported previously, the TSC1+/- Bama miniature pig developed cardiac rhabdomyoma and subependymal nodules, resembling the major clinical features that occur in patients with TSC. These TSC1+/- Bama miniature pigs could serve as valuable large animal models for further elucidation of the pathogenesis of TSC and the development of therapeutic strategies for TSC disease.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder featured with multi-organ benign tumours. Disruption of TSC1/TSC2 complex suppression on mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling causes TSC. Hyperactive mTOR-mediated negative feedback regulation of AKT partially contributes to the benign nature of TSC-associated tumours. In this study, we demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN) was dramatically reduced by loss of TSC1/TSC2 complex in Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient cells, genetically modified mouse TSC models, and clinical samples. TSC1/TSC2 complex upregulation of OPN expression is mediated by transcription factor SOX9 in an mTOR-independent manner. Moreover, ablation of OPN by deficient TSC1/TSC2 complex contributed to inactivation of AKT in TSC cells. Lastly, the abundance of OPN dictated the potency of cell proliferation and tumour development. Therefore, loss of TSC1/TSC2 complex led to mTOR-independent inhibition of AKT at least partially through downregulation of the SOX9-OPN signalling cascade. We suggest that the decreased SOX9-OPN-AKT signalling pathway safeguard against the development of malignant tumours in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, interact to form a protein complex that inhibits signal transduction to the downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here we investigate the effects of putative TSC1 missense mutations identified in individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TSC on TSC1-TSC2 complex formation and mTOR signalling. We show that specific amino-acid substitutions close to the N-terminal of TSC1 reduce steady-state levels of TSC1, resulting in the activation of mTOR signalling and leading to the symptoms of TSC.",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have reported that microRNA (miR)-92b-3p is involved in various cellular processes related to carcinogenesis, its physiological role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. To clarify the role of miR-92b-3p in ccRCC, we compared miR-92b-3p expression levels in ccRCC tissues and adjacent normal renal tissues. Significant upregulation of miR-92b-3p was observed in ccRCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-92b-3p using a miRNA mimic promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion activities of ACHN cells. Functional inhibition of miR-92b-3p by a hairpin miRNA inhibitor suppressed Caki-2 cell growth and invasion activities in vitro. Mechanistically, it was found that miR-92b-3p directly targeted the TSC1 gene, a known upstream regulator of mTOR. Overexpression of miR-92b-3p decreased the protein expression of TSC1 and enhanced the downstream phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, suggesting that the mTOR signaling pathway was activated by miR-92b-3p in RCC cells. Importantly, a multivariate Cox proportion hazard model, based on TNM staging and high levels of miR-92b-3p, revealed that miR-92b-3p expression (high vs. low hazard ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-6.83; P = .018) was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival of ccRCC patients with surgical management. Taken together, miR-92b-3p was found to act as an oncomiR, promoting cell proliferation by downregulating TSC1 in ccRCC.",

    "issue": "64(5)",
    "pages": "988-94",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSubependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) are slow-growing benign intraventricular tumors, the pathogenesis of which is debated. Recent studies have shown that tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and TSC2 genes are linked to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell signaling pathway. We aimed to analyze TSC1 and TSC2 gene mutation, hamartin and tuberin protein expression, and protein expression of mTOR signaling cascade in a series of SEGA to determine their role in pathogenesis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwenty-eight SEGA cases were retrieved from archival material. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using antibodies against tuberin, hamartin, phospho-p70S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal protein, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, phospho-4E-BP1, Stat3, and phospho-Stat3. Mutation analysis of TSC1 (exons 15 and 17) and TSC2 (exons 33, 39, and 40) was done by DNA sequencing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLoss of immunoexpression of either hamartin or tuberin was found in 19 cases (68%). Pathogenic point mutations in selected exons of TSC1 and TSC2 genes were present in 5 of 20 cases studied. Robust expression of mTOR downstream signaling molecules phospho-p70S6 kinase (100%), S6 ribosomal protein (82%), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (64%), phospho-4E-BP1 (64%), and Stat3 (100%) was seen. Four cases (14%) showed immunopositivity for phospho-Stat3. There was no significant correlation of these markers with immunoloss of tuberin and hamartin.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThere is a definite role for TSC1 and TSC2 genes in the pathogenesis of SEGA as evidenced by loss of protein expression and presence of mutations. Strong expression of mTOR downstream signaling proteins indicates activation of mTOR pathway in these tumors, suggesting that proteins in this pathway may have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets in these patients.",

    "issue": "11()",
    "pages": "409",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder affecting the brain and other vital organs. Neurological symptoms include epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These gene products form a protein complex and normally suppress mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. mTOR inhibitors have been used to treat subependymal glioma (SEGA) that is a brain tumor characteristic of TSC. However, neuropathology of TSC also involves dysregulated cortical circuit formation including neuronal migration, axodendritic differentiation, and synapse formation. It is currently unknown to what extent mTOR signaling inhibitors correct an alteration in neuronal morphology that have already formed prior to the treatment. Here, we address the efficacy of rapamycin treatment on neuronal migration and dendrite formation. Using in utero electroporation, we suppressed Tsc1 expression in a fraction of neuronal progenitor cells during the fetal period. In embryonic brain slices, we found that more Tsc1-suppressed cells remained within the periventricular zone, and rapamycin treatment facilitated neuronal migration. Postnatally, Tsc1-suppressed pyramidal neurons showed more complex branching of basal dendrites and a higher spine density at postnatal day (P) 28. Aberrant arborization was normalized by rapamycin administration every other day between P1 and P13 but not P15 and P27. In contrast, abnormal spine maturation improved by rapamycin treatment between P15 and P27 but not P1 and P13. Our results indicate that there are multiple critical windows for correcting different aspects of structural abnormalities in TSC, and the responses depend on the stage of neuronal circuit formation. These data warrant a search for an additional therapeutic target to treat neurological symptoms of TSC.",

    "abstract": "1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2 D3) is a secosteroid with antiproliferative property. It also plays a pivotal renoprotective role in diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether 1,25(OH)2D3 could inhibit the proliferation of rat mesangial cells exposed to high glucose via the DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4/mammalian target of rapamycin(DDIT4/mTOR) pathway. The cell proliferation rate and cell cycle duration were measured using cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry. Protein expression was assayed by Western blot. Glucose acted as a growth factor in rat mesangial cells, promoted cell proliferation. In parallel, the protein expression of DDIT4, TSC1/TSC2, and 4E-BP1 were decreased, and Rheb, mTOR, and p70S6K were increased. Acting via the DDIT4/mTOR signaling, 1,25(OH)2 D3 treatment reversed these pathological changes, upregulated DDIT4, TSC1/TSC2, and 4E-BP1, downregulated Rheb, mTOR, and p70S6K. The short-term overexpression of DDIT4 inhibited the proliferation of rat mesangial cells, similar to 1,25(OH)2 D3 treatment. siRNA knockdown of DDIT4 suppressed antiproliferative responses to 1,25(OH)2 D3. These results suggest that 1,25(OH)2 D3 inhibits the proliferation of rat mesangial cells induced by high glucose via the DDIT4/mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nActivation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the development of several malignancies and alterations in TSC1, TSC2, STK11 and NF1, can lead to the dysregulation of this pathway. Furthermore, mutations in TSC1 and NF2 are known to confer sensitivity to everolimus-an mTOR inhibitor. Based on these data, a single-arm, open label, single-institution phase II basket study was designed to assess the activity of everolimus in patients with solid malignancies whose tumors harbored mutations in TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2, or STK11.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 12 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumors (metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable) with mutations in TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2 or STK11 genes, who had failed at least one line of standard of care systemic therapy, were enrolled to this open label, single-arm study. Presence of mutations in TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2 or STK11 genes was assessed using targeted-next generation sequencing (NGS). All eligible patients were treated with everolimus at an initial dose of 10 mg orally once daily in cycles of 28 days. The primary endpoint of this study was overall response rate (ORR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 12 patients enrolled, 8 were evaluable for response at the end of 2 cycles. One complete response (CR) was observed (12.5%) and one patient (12.5%) had stable disease (SD), while six (75%) patients showed disease progression. Everolimus was overall well tolerated with anemia, decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, peripheral edema and hyperglycemia representing the most common adverse events. One patient discontinued treatment due to a treatment related grade 4 pericardial effusion. Both patients with CR or SD had a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with NF1 or STK11 mutations, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough this study failed to meet its prespecified ORR threshold for success of 30% or higher, exploratory analyses suggest potential activity for everolimus in a subset of patients with lung adenocarcinomas with STK11 or NF1 mutations. Further studies are necessary to systematically explore the clinical activity of everolimus, potentially as a combination therapy, in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in 20-60% of cases. In addition, altered TSC/mTOR signaling is emerging as a feature common to a subset of ASD. Recent findings, in animal models, show that restoration of the underlying molecular defect can improve neurological dysfunction in several of these models, even if treatment is initiated in adult animals, suggesting that pathophysiological processes in the mature brain contribute significantly to the overall neurological phenotype in these models. These findings suggest that windows for therapeutic intervention in ASD could be wider than thought previously.",

    "pages": "7369351",
    "abstract": "The TSC1/2 heterodimer, a key upstream regulator of the mTOR, can inhibit the activation of mTOR, which plays a critical role in immune responses after bacterial infections. Monocytes are an innate immune cell type that have been shown to be involved in bacteremia. However, how the mTOR pathway is involved in the regulation of monocytes is largely unknown. In our study, TSC1 KO mice and WT mice were infected with E. coli. When compared to WT mice, we found higher mortality, greater numbers of bacteria, decreased expression of coactivators in monocytes, increased numbers of Tregs, and decreased numbers of effector T cells in TSC1 KO mice. Monocytes obtained from TSC1 KO mice produced more ROS, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-β and less IL-1, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibited immune functioning in TSC1 KO mice is influenced by mTORC1 activation in monocytes. The reduced expression of coactivators resulted in inhibited effector T cell proliferation. mTORC1-activated monocytes are harmful during bacterial infections. Therefore, inhibiting mTORC1 signaling through rapamycin administration could rescue the harmful aspects of an overactive immune response, and this knowledge provides a new direction for clinical therapy.",

We report on a patient with advanced HCC carrying the TSC1 gene mutation who responded well to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus. Computed tomography revealed tumor shrinkage and maintenance of partial remission after everolimus treatment for >12.3 months.

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by a range of lesions including cortical tubers, white matter heterotopias, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Recent studies have implicated an important role for the TSC genes TSC1 and TSC2, in a signaling pathway involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. We performed immunohistochemical and genetic analyses on SEGAs from 7 TSC patients, 4 with mutations in TSC1, and 3 with mutations in TSC2. SEGA cells show high levels of phospho-S6K, phospho-S6, and phospho-Stat3, all proteins downstream of and indicative of mTOR activation. Such expression is not seen in histologically normal control tissue. Five of 6 SEGAs also showed evidence of biallelic mutation of TSC1 or TSC2, suggesting that SEGAs develop due to complete loss of a functional tuberin-hamartin complex. We conclude that TSC SEGAs likely arise through a two-hit mechanism of biallelic inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2, leading to activation of the mTOR kinase.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo explore the mechanism of electropuncture (EA) for reducing diet-induced obesity (DIO) rat weight through tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1 )-mammalian target of rapa- mycin (mTOR) signal pathway in hypothalamus.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty male SD rats were randomly divided into the model group (n =30) and the normal control group (n =10). DIO rat model was prepared by high fat forage for 12 successive weeks. Successfully modeled 19 rats were further randomly divided into the model group (n =9) and the EA group (n =10). EA at Tianshu (ST25) , Sanyinjiao (SP6) , Zhongwan ( RN12) , Zusanli (ST36) was performed in the EA group, 5 successive days per week with a 2-day rest, 4 weeks in total. No intervention was given to rats in the model group and the normal control group. Body weight was observed in all rats. Methylation of TSC1 promotor was detected by bisulfite sequencing method. mRNA expression of mTOR in hypothalamus was detected by RT-PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter EA treatment body weight in the EA group were obviously reduced (P <0. 05). Compared with the normal control group, body weight was not statistically different between the model group and the EA group after treatment (P> 0. 05). Methylation rate of TSC1 promotor was higher in model group (94. 0% ±4. 5%) than in the normal control group (87. 0% ±3. 6%) and the EA group (87. 4% ±3. 9%) (P <0. 05). Expression of mTOR in the model group (1. 84 ±0. 51) was higher than that in the normal control group (1. 02 ±0. 22) and the EA group (1. 46 ±0. 29) (P <0. 05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEA could lower DIO rats' body weight by down-regulating methylation rate of TSC1 promotor and regulating expression of mTOR in hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumor suppressor that associates with TSC2 to inactivate Rheb, thereby inhibiting signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 stimulates cell growth by promoting anabolic cellular processes, such as translation, in response to growth factors and nutrient signals. In order to test roles for TSC1 and mTORC1 in β-cell function, we utilized Rip2/Cre to generate mice lacking Tsc1 in pancreatic β cells (Rip-Tsc1cKO mice). While obesity developed due to hypothalamic Tsc1 excision in older Rip-Tsc1cKO animals, young animals displayed a prominent gain-of-function β-cell phenotype prior to the onset of obesity. The young Rip-Tsc1cKO animals displayed improved glycemic control due to mTOR-mediated enhancement of β-cell size and insulin production, but not β-cell number consistent with an important anabolic role for mTOR in β-cell function. Thus, mTOR promulgates a dominant signal to promote β-cell/islet size and insulin production, and this pathway is crucial for β-cell function and glycemic control. Here, we describe the methods of analyzing tissue-specific ablation of Tsc1 in pancreatic β cells.",

We report here that TSC1 differentially regulates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2/Akt signaling in B cells. TSC1 deficiency results in the accumulation of transitional-1 (T1) B cells and progressive losses of B cells as they mature beyond the T1 stage. Moreover, TSC1KO mice exhibit a mild defect in the serum antibody responses or rate of Ig class-switch recombination after immunization with a T-cell-dependent antigen. In contrast to a previous report, we demonstrate that both constitutive Peyer's patch germinal centers (GCs) and immunization-induced splenic GCs are unimpaired in TSC1-deficient (TSC1KO) mice and that the ratio of GC B cells to total B cells is comparable in WT and TSC1KO mice. Together, our data demonstrate that TSC1 plays important roles for B cell development, but it is dispensable for GC formation and serum antibody responses.",

The TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressors are major upstream inhibitory regulators of mTOR signaling. Mice with Rip2/Cre-mediated deletion of Tsc1 (Rip-Tsc1cKO mice) developed hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting that hypothalamic disruption (for which Rip2/Cre is well known) of Tsc1 may dysregulate feeding circuits via mTOR activation. Indeed, Rip-Tsc1cKO mice displayed increased mTOR signaling and enlarged neuron cell size in a number of hypothalamic populations, including Pomc neurons. Furthermore, Tsc1 deletion with Pomc/Cre (Pomc-Tsc1cKO mice) resulted in dysregulation of Pomc neurons and hyperphagic obesity. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, ameliorated the hyperphagia, obesity, and the altered Pomc neuronal morphology in developing or adult Pomc-Tsc1cKO mice, and cessation of treatment reinstated these phenotypes. Thus, ongoing mTOR activation in Pomc neurons blocks the catabolic function of these neurons to promote nutrient intake and increased adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations. TSC causes the development of tumors in various organs such as the brain, skin, kidney, lung, and heart. The protein complex TSC1/2 has been reported to have an inhibitory function on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors has demonstrated tumor‑reducing effects in patients with TSC but is also associated with various adverse effects. In recent years, experiments involving in vivo differentiation of pluripotent stem cells have been reported as useful in elucidating mechanisms of pathogenesis and discovering new therapeutic targets for several diseases. To reveal the molecular basis of the pathogenesis caused by the Tsc2 mutation, we derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from Eker rats, which have the Tsc2 mutation and develop brain lesions and renal tumors. Although several studies have reported the necessity of Tsc1 and Tsc2 regulation to maintain ESCs and hematopoietic stem cells, we successfully established not only Tsc2+/+ and Tsc2+/- ESCs but also Tsc2-/- ESCs. We confirmed that these cells express pluripotency markers and retain the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers. Comprehensive gene expression analysis of Tsc2+/+ and Tsc2+/- ESCs revealed similar profiles, whereas the profile of Tsc2-/- ESCs was distinct from these two. In vitro differentiation experiments using these ESCs combined with in vivo experiments may reveal the mechanism of the tissue‑specific pathogenesis caused by the Tsc2 mutation and identify specific new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The genes TSC1 and TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have been shown to be involved in the development of the autosomal dominantly inherited tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis (TSC). However, inactivation of these genes has also been demonstrated to be associated with sporadic bladder cancer, ovarian and gall bladder carcinoma, non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, astrocytoma, xanthoastrocytoma, ependymomas, oral squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. The hamartin/tuberin protein complex plays a central role in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling network. A wide variety of components of the mTOR cascade have been demonstrated to be involved in many different human cancers. Mutations in several mTOR pathway component genes are known to cause specific monogenic human genetic diseases and this signalling cascade has been shown to be of relevance for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertrophy. Consequently, e.g. clinical trials for the treatment with rapamycin, a negative regulator of mTOR, of hamartomas in TSC have already been initiated. Now the first evidence is provided for an involvement of the TSC genes in acute leukemia.",

    "pages": "E4894-903",
    "abstract": "Coordination of cell metabolism and immune signals is crucial for lymphocyte priming. Emerging evidence also highlights the importance of cell metabolism for the activation of innate immunity upon pathogen challenge, but there is little evidence of how this process contributes to immune cell development. Here we show that differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) from bone marrow precursors is associated with dynamic regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and cell metabolism. Unexpectedly, enhancing mTORC1 activity via ablation of its negative regulator tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) impaired DC development in vivo and in vitro, associated with defective cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, Tsc1 deficiency caused DC spontaneous maturation but a propensity to differentiate into other lineages, and attenuated DC-mediated effector TH1 responses. Mechanistically, Tsc1-deficient DCs exhibited increased glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and lipid synthesis that were partly mediated by the transcription factor Myc, highlighting a key role of Tsc1 in modulating metabolic programming of DC differentiation. Further, Tsc1 signaled through Rheb to down-regulate mTORC1 for proper DC development, whereas its effect at modulating mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) activity was largely dispensable. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between Tsc1-Rheb-mTORC1 signaling and Myc-dependent bioenergetic and biosynthetic activities constitutes a key metabolic checkpoint to orchestrate DC development.",

    "issue": "7()",
    "pages": "12730",
    "abstract": "Activation of metabolic signalling by IL-15 is required for natural killer (NK) cell development. Here we show that Tsc1, a repressor of mTOR, is dispensable for the terminal maturation, survival and function of NK cells but is critical to restrict exhaustive proliferation of immature NK cells and activation downstream of IL-15 during NK cell development. Tsc1 is expressed in immature NK cells and is upregulated by IL-15. Haematopoietic-specific deletion of Tsc1 causes a marked decrease in the number of NK cells and compromises rejection of 'missing-self' haematopoietic tumours and allogeneic bone marrow. The residual Tsc1-null NK cells display activated, pro-apoptotic phenotype and elevated mTORC1 activity. Deletion of Raptor, a component of mTORC1, largely reverses these defects. Tsc1-deficient NK cells express increased levels of T-bet and downregulate Eomes and CD122, a subunit of IL-15 receptor. These results reveal a role for Tsc1-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 activation during immature NK cell development.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) loss of function reduces adiposity whereas partial mTORC1 inhibition enhances fat deposition. Herein we evaluated how constitutive mTORC1 activation in adipocytes modulates adiposity in vivo. Mice with constitutive mTORC1 activation in adipocytes induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc)1 deletion and littermate controls were evaluated for body mass, energy expenditure, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial function, mRNA and protein contents. Adipocyte-specific Tsc1 deletion reduced visceral, but not subcutaneous, fat mass, as well as adipocyte number and diameter, phenotypes that were associated with increased lipolysis, UCP-1 content (browning) and mRNA levels of pro-browning transcriptional factors C/EBPβ and ERRα. Adipocyte Tsc1 deletion enhanced mitochondrial oxidative activity, fatty acid oxidation and the expression of PGC-1α and PPARα in both visceral and subcutaneous fat. In brown adipocytes, however, Tsc1 deletion did not affect UCP-1 content and basal respiration. Adipocyte Tsc1 deletion also reduced visceral adiposity and enhanced glucose tolerance, liver and muscle insulin signaling and adiponectin secretion in mice fed with purified low- or high-fat diet. In conclusion, adipocyte-specific Tsc1 deletion enhances mitochondrial activity, induces browning and reduces visceral adiposity in mice.",

    "issue": "18(8)",
    "pages": "824-833",
    "abstract": "The primordial follicle pool, providing all oocytes available to a female throughout her reproductive life, is established perinatally. The formation of primordial follicle pool is regulated by precise transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recent studies have identified several microRNAs as post-transcriptional regulatory factors in the process of primordial follicle assembly. Here, we showed that miR-92b-3p was significantly upregulated in the stage of primordial follicle assembly in newborn mouse ovaries. Inhibiting miR-92b-3p suppressed the formation of primordial follicles, while overexpression of miR-92b-3p accelerated the processes of cyst breakdown and the following primordial follicle assembly. Accordingly, the expression of follicular development-related genes was reduced upon inhibiting of miR-92b-3p and increased under miR-92b-3p overexpression. Mechanistic studies identified TSC1 as a direct target of miR-92b-3p. miR-92b-3p could activate mTOR/Rps6 signaling through targeting and inhibiting TSC1 expression. In addition, knockdown of TSC1 showed an identical phenotype with that of miR-92b-3p overexpression in accelerating processes of cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation. Thus, our work demonstrates that miR-92b-3p is a novel regulator of primordial follicle assembly by negatively regulating TSC1 in mTOR/Rps6 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials are underway for the treatment of tuberous sclerosis (TSC)-associated tumours using mTOR inhibitors. Here, we show that many of the earliest renal lesions from Tsc1+/- and Tsc2+/- mice do not exhibit mTOR activation, suggesting that pharmacological targeting of an alternative pathway may be necessary to prevent tumour formation. Patients with TSC often develop renal cysts and those with inherited co-deletions of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 1 gene (PKD1) develop severe, early onset, polycystic kidneys. Using mouse models, we showed a genetic interaction between Tsc1 and Tsc2 with Pkd1 and confirmed an mTOR-independent pathway of renal cystogenesis. We observed that the Tsc and Pkd1 gene products helped regulate primary cilia length and, consistent with the function of this organelle in modulating cell polarity, found that many dividing pre-cystic renal tubule and hepatic bile duct cells from Tsc1, Tsc2 and Pkd1 heterozygous mice were highly misoriented. We therefore propose that defects in cell polarity underlie TSC and ADPKD-associated cystic disease and targeting of this pathway may be of key therapeutic benefit.",

    "issue": "98(3)",
    "pages": "686-698",
    "abstract": "Energy reprogramming to glycolysis is closely associated with the development of chronic kidney disease. As an important negative regulatory factor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signal, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) is also a key regulatory point of glycolysis. Here, we investigated whether Tsc1 could mediate the progression of kidney interstitial fibrosis by regulating glycolysis in proximal tubular epithelial cells. We induced mTORC1 signal activation in tubular epithelial cells in kidneys with fibrosis via unilateral ureteral occlusion. This resulted in increased tubular epithelial cell proliferation and glycolytic enzyme upregulation. Prior incubation with rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 activation and abolished the enhanced glycolysis and tubular epithelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, knockdown of Tsc1 expression promoted glycolysis in the rat kidney epithelial cell line NRK-52E. Specific deletion of Tsc1 in the proximal tubules of mice resulted in enlarged kidneys characterized by a high proportion of proliferative tubular epithelial cells, dilated tubules with cyst formation, and a large area of interstitial fibrosis in conjunction with elevated glycolysis. Treatment of the mice with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose notably ameliorated tubular epithelial cell proliferation, cystogenesis, and kidney fibrosis. Thus, our findings suggest that Tsc1-associated mTORC1 signaling mediates the progression of kidney interstitial fibrosis by regulating glycolysis in proximal tubular epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSignaling between androgen receptor (AR) and mTOR may be crucial for prostate cancer cells to endure the low androgen and suboptimal nutrient conditions produced by androgen deprivation therapy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAR and mTOR cross-talk was examined in LNCaP cells exposed to either high or low testosterone. AR and mTOR activities were modified separately using either siRNA knockdown or specific chemical inhibitor. The biological significance of the reciprocal communication was assessed by susceptibility to glucose deprivation-induced cell death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAR positively regulated mTOR activity in both low and high testosterone levels. TSC1 and TSC2, the two negative regulators of mTOR, may be involved since both were up-regulated by AR knockdown. Sub-baseline mTOR increased AR protein levels. However, this effect only occurred with low testosterone. More cells underwent apoptosis if AR function was inhibited during glucose deprivation, which significantly depressed mTOR activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe compensatory increase of AR function due to a repressed mTOR signal is advantageous for survival. Disrupting this loop at the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy may delay, or even prevent, the recurrence of prostate cancer.",

    "issue": "98(12)",
    "pages": "905-912",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPerivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal soft tissue neoplasm often linked to mTOR pathway activation via TSC2 mutation. We analyzed a series of 31 consecutive metastatic PEComa (mPEComa) cases using a combined DNA/RNA hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to assess the genomic landscape of mPEComa.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks or slides were obtained from tumors from 31 unique patients with mPEC-oma. DNA and RNA were extracted and CGP was performed on 405 genes using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay in a CLIA-certified lab.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll cases had locally advanced or metastatic disease, and 58% of patients were female with a median age of 50 years (range 8-76), and 17 and 14 specimens were from primary and metastatic sites, respectively. One hundred genomic alterations were identified in the cohort, with an average of 3.2 genomic alterations/case including alterations in TSC2 32.3% of cases (10), TSC1 9.6% (3), TFE3 16.1% (5, all fusions), and folliculin (FLCN) 6.4% (2), with all occurring in mutually exclusive fashion. Of TSC2 mutant cases, 70% had biallelic inactivation of this locus, as were 100% of TSC1 mutant cases. Two TSC1/2 wildtype cases harbored truncating mutations in FLCN, both of which were under LOH. Five TFE3 fusion cases were identified including the novel 5' fusion partner ZC3H4.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe describe for the first time mPEComa cases with FLCN mutations under LOH, further characterizing dysregulation of the mTOR pathway as a unifying theme in mPEC-oma. Cumulatively, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of segregating mPEComa by TSC, TFE3, and FLCN status via CGP in clinical care.",

    "issue": "114(3)",
    "pages": "287-93",
    "abstract": "Hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) is a developmental brain malformation highly associated with epilepsy. Balloon cells (BCs) and cytomegalic neurons (CNs) are frequently observed in HMEG specimens. Cytomegaly in developmental brain malformations may reflect in aberrant activation of the mTOR and beta-catenin signaling cascades, known regulators of cell size. We hypothesized that there is aberrant co-expression of phospho-ribosomal S6 (P-S6) protein, a downstream effector of the mTOR cascade, as well as cyclin D1, a downstream effector of the beta-catenin pathway, in BCs and cytomegalic neurons in HMEG. We hypothesized that mutations in PTEN (a cause of HMEG associated with Proteus syndrome), TSC1 or TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) genes, which are known to modulate beta-catenin and mTOR signaling could cause sporadic HMEG. Expression of cyclin D1, phospho-p70 S6 kinase (P-p70S6K, another mTOR cascade kinase), P-S6, MAP2, NeuN, or GFAP was determined by immunohistochemistry in HMEG brain tissue (n = 7 specimens). Cyclin D1, P-p70S6K, and P-S6 proteins were co-localized in BCs and CNs in the enlarged hemisphere but not in the unaffected hemisphere or in morphologically normal tissue. Cyclin D1 and P-S6 proteins were not detected in GFAP-labeled astrocytes. Sequencing of PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 genes in cytomegalic cells co-expressing cyclin D1 and P-S6 proteins did not reveal mutations. Selective expression of cyclin D1 and P-S6 in cytomegalic cells in HMEG suggests co-activation of the beta-catenin and mTOR cascades. PTEN, TSC1, or TSC2 gene mutations were not detected suggesting that sporadic HMEG is distinct from HMEG associated with Proteus syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by systemic hamartoma and diverse systemic features. TSC1 and TSC2 are the causative genes, and mental retardation, epileptic seizures, and facial angiofibroma develop in many patients with the disease. The case of a patient with TSC who developed a central odontogenic fibroma of the mandible is reported here. The patient was a 21-year-old woman who was referred with a swelling of the labial gingiva in the region of the right lower lateral incisor and canine. Dental radiography revealed a multilocular radiolucent region with a clear boundary. The right lower lateral incisor and canine were continuous with the lesion and thus were excised en bloc. The lesion was encapsulated and easily dissected. The diagnosis on immunohistological staining was odontogenic fibroma without an epithelial component. TSC1/2 gene mutation causes abnormal activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of the PI3K-AKT pathway. The odontogenic fibroma in this patient was positive for mTOR, suggesting that the development of the odontogenic fibroma was the result of abnormal activation of mTOR, as in angiofibroma. The clinical course of this patient is presented and the developmental mechanism of central odontogenic fibroma is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma(SEGA)is a low-grade brain tumor occurring specifically in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex(TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant genetic disease affecting multiple body systems and with wide variability in presentation. SEGA usually arises around the caudothalamic groove near the foramen of Monro, and can therefore cause life-threatening complications due to hydrocephalus. SEGA develops due to complete loss of function of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through a two-hit mechanism of biallelic inactivation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, leading to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR). Identification of a pathogenic variant in TSC1 or TSC2 is sufficient for the diagnosis of TSC. Individuals with SEGAs presenting with acute deterioration due to obstructive hydrocephalus should undergo urgent surgical treatment. mTOR inhibitors have been shown to prevent SEGA growth in patients with TSC. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors is primarily recommended for individuals with non-acute symptomatic or asymptomatic growing or large SEGAs and those who are not surgical candidates or prefer medical treatment over surgery. Long-term treatment with mTOR inhibitors efficiently reduced SEGAs and prevented hydrocephalus. The surgical risks, potential side effects of mTOR inhibitors, and effect on other TSC manifestations should be considered so that the best treatment option is selected.",

    "abstract": "The pathology associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) shows diverse phenotypes that suggest abnormal signaling of multiple pathways. Besides the negative regulatory role of the TSC1/TSC2 proteins on mTOR, we have reported an effect on beta-catenin signaling at the level of the degradation complex in vitro. The TSC1/TSC2 complex associates with GSK3 and Axin and promotes beta-catenin degradation to inhibit Wnt-stimulated TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. Here, we show that beta-catenin and its effectors, cyclin D1 and connexin 43, were up-regulated in TSC-related angiomyolipomas and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This was supported by the failure of three disease-causing TSC2 missense mutants to inhibit Wnt signaling. Further, the interaction between TSC1/TSC2 and components of the beta-catenin degradation complex was dependent on Wnt stimulation such that binding of tuberin to GSK3 and Axin was reduced in the presence of Wnt whereas the tuberin-Dishevelled interaction was increased. GSK3 activity played a role in regulating the assembly/stability of the degradation complex. Inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride reduced its association with TSC1 whereas disruption of GSK3-phosphorylation sites in TSC1 reduced interaction between TSC2 and TSC1. Collectively, our data provide further evidence that beta-catenin signaling plays a role in TSC pathogenesis in vivo and suggest a novel role of GSK3 in modulating the TSC1/TSC2 complex through TSC1 phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, form a complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1). Previously, we demonstrated that pathogenic amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain of TSC1 (amino acids 50-224) are destabilizing. Here we investigate an additional 21 unclassified TSC1 variants. Our functional assessment identified four substitutions (p.L61R, p.G132D, p.F158S, and p.R204P) between amino acids 50 and 224 that reduced TSC1 stability and prevented the TSC1-TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1. In four cases (20%), our functional assessment did not agree with the predictions of the SIFT amino acid substitution analysis software. Our new data confirm our previous finding that the N-terminal region of TSC1 is essential for TSC1 function.",

    "pages": "68-77",
    "abstract": "Garcinia mangostana, often referred to as mangosteen, is a fruit grown in Southeast Asia and has been used for centuries as a local beverage and natural medicine. Its bioactive compounds, xanthones (i.e., gartanin, α-mangostin, etc), have reported effects on ailments ranging from skin infections and inflammation to urinary tract infections. We demonstrate that mangosteen xanthones (i.e., gartanin and α-mangostin) at pharmacologically achievable concentrations inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines from different stages of human urinary bladder cancer. The growth inhibitory effects of gartanin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts are at least in part dependent on the existence of p53 or TSC1. Indeed, further studies have shown that gartanin treatment of bladder cancer cell lines T24 and RT4 resulted in a marked suppression of p70S6 and 4E-BP1 expression and induction of autophagy, suggesting the inhibition of the mTOR pathway. In addition, gartanin downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and activated the p53 pathway leading to apoptosis induction. Together, these results suggested that gartanin is a multiple targeting agent that is suitable for further study into its chemopreventive properties for human urinary bladder cancer.",

    "issue": "11()",
    "pages": "835",
    "abstract": "The sustained high morbidity and mortality of Candida sepsis are mainly caused by compromise of host immunity. Clinically, it is often manifested as a significant decrease in CD4+ T cell count, although the mechanism is unclear. We established a lethal mice Candida sepsis model and used Murine Sepsis Score to group mice with different disease severity to establish the influence of T-bet expression on CD4+ T cell count in Candida sepsis. We found that CD4+ T cell count decreased in Candida-infected compared to uninfected mice, and the degree of decrease increased with aggravation of sepsis. Expression of T-bet similarly decreased with worsening of sepsis, but it was significantly enhanced in candidiasis in comparison of naïve state. To clarify its possible mechanism, we measured the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a key regulator of T-bet expression. The mTOR pathway was activated after infection and its activity increased with progression of sepsis. We used mice with T-cell-specific knockout of mTOR or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 to further inhibit or strengthen the mTOR signaling pathway. We found that mTOR deletion mice had a higher CD4+ T cell count by regulating T-bet expression, and the result in TSC1 deletion mice was reversed. These results demonstrate that T-bet expression mediated by the mTOR pathway influences the CD4+ T cell count in mice with Candida sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The IGF/mTOR pathway, which is modulated by nutrients, growth factors, energy status and cellular stress regulates aging in various organisms. SIRT1 is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase that is known to regulate caloric restriction mediated longevity in model organisms, and has also been linked to the insulin/IGF signaling pathway. Here we investigated the potential regulation of mTOR signaling by SIRT1 in response to nutrients and cellular stress. We demonstrate that SIRT1 deficiency results in elevated mTOR signaling, which is not abolished by stress conditions. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1 interacts with TSC2, a component of the mTOR inhibitory-complex upstream to mTORC1, and regulates mTOR signaling in a TSC2 dependent manner. These results demonstrate that SIRT1 negatively regulates mTOR signaling potentially through the TSC1/2 complex.",

These cases were divided into 7 study groups and immunohistochemical EnVision method was used. To detect the location and intensity of TSC1, TSC2, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-p70S6K and p-S6 expression in every group. Then the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 image processing and analysis software were used to measure the number, area, integrating absorbance (IA) of positive cells in every samples. The statistical software SPSS 16.0 was used to analyze the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe immunolocalization of TSC1 and TSC2 was similar. It could be observed the expression of various levels in the cytoplasm of dysmorphic neurons, balloon cells, giant cells, ganglioglioma cells and normal neurons. TSC1 staining in normal neurons was more notably than others but TSC2 staining in giant cells was weaker than other samples. p-mTOR mainly presented in giant cells, which could also be observed in astrocyte. P-4E-BP1 presented in the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane of balloon cells, giant cells and ganglioglioma cells, the staining of giant cells was stronger than balloon cells, but their staining were weaker than ganglioglioma cells. P-p70S6K mainly expressed in giant cells and less commonly presented in balloon cells. P-S6 typically presented in all abnormal glioneuronal cells and it nearly did not present in the normal neurons of N-CTX group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPI3K pathway, at least in part, involves in the occurrence of MCD, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder associated with epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and autistic behaviors. These neurological symptoms result from synaptic dysregulations, which shift a balance between excitation and inhibition. To decipher the synaptic substrate of hyperexcitability, we examined pan-neuronal Tsc1 knockout mouse and found a reduction in surface expression of a GABA receptor (GABAR) subunit but not AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit. Using electrophysiological recordings, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABAR-mIPSCs) but not AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs) in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. To determine a subpopulation of interneurons that are especially vulnerable to the absence of TSC1 function, we also analyzed two strains of conditional knockout mice targeting two of the prominent interneuron subtypes that express parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST). Unlike pan-neuronal knockout mice, both interneuron-specific Tsc-1 knockout mice did not develop spontaneous seizures and grew into adults. Further, the properties of AMPAR-mEPSCs and GABAR-mIPSCs were normal in both Pv-Cre and Sst-Cre x Tsc1fl/fl knockout mice. These results indicate that removal of TSC1 from all neurons in a local cortical circuit results in hyperexcitability while connections between pyramidal neurons and interneurons expressing PV and SST are preserved in the layer 2/3 visual cortex. Our study suggests that another inhibitory cell type or a combination of multiple subtypes may be accountable for hyperexcitability in TSC.",

    "title": "mTORC1 activation in B cells confers impairment of marginal zone microarchitecture by exaggerating cathepsin activity.",
    "issue": "155(4)",
    "pages": "505-518",
    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell metabolism and lymphocyte proliferation. It is inhibited by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a heterodimer of TSC1 and TSC2. Deletion of either gene results in robust activation of mTORC1. Mature B cells reside in the spleen at two major anatomical locations, the marginal zone (MZ) and follicles. The MZ constitutes the first line of humoral response against blood-borne pathogens and undergoes atrophy in chronic inflammation. In previous work, we showed that mice deleted for TSC1 in their B cells (TSC1BKO ) have almost no MZ B cells, whereas follicular B cells are minimally affected. To explore potential underlying mechanisms for MZ B-cell loss, we have analysed the spleen MZ architecture of TSC1BKO mice and found it to be severely impaired. Examination of lymphotoxins (LTα and LTβ) and lymphotoxin receptor (LTβR) expression indicated that LTβR levels in spleen stroma were reduced by TSC1 deletion in the B cells. Furthermore, LTα transcripts in B cells were reduced. Because LTβR is sensitive to proteolysis, we analysed cathepsin activity in TSC1BKO . A higher cathepsin activity, particularly of cathepsin B, was observed, which was reduced by mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin in vivo. Remarkably, in vivo administration of a pan-cathepsin inhibitor restored LTβR expression, LTα mRNA levels and the MZ architecture. Our data identify a novel connection, although not elucidated at the molecular level, between mTORC1 and cathepsin activity in a manner relevant to MZ dynamics.",

    "title": "Curcumin inhibits Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling through protein phosphatase-dependent mechanism.",
    "issue": "7(9)",
    "pages": "2609-20",
    "abstract": "Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and is dysregulated in many tumors, especially metastatic prostate cancers. Curcumin has been shown to effectively prevent or inhibit prostate cancer in vivo and inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling in vitro, but the mechanism(s) remains unclear. Here, we show that curcumin concentration- and time-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and their downstream substrates in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and this inhibitory effect acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or disruption of TSC1-TSC2 complex by small interfering RNA or gene knockout only partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream signaling, indicating that they are not the primary effectors of curcumin-mediated inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition of these kinases failed to rescue the inhibition by curcumin. Finally, it was shown that the inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling by curcumin is resulted from calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation. Our study reveals the profound effects of curcumin on the Akt/mTOR signaling network in PC-3 cells and provides new mechanisms for the anticancer effects of curcumin.",

We report the case of a 5-year-old female carrying the TSC1 variant c.843del p.(Ser282Glnfs*36) who presented with a mild phenotype of tuberous sclerosis, including carbamazepine-responsive SHE, normal neurocognitive functioning, hypomelanotic macules, no abnormalities outside the central nervous system, and tubers at neuroimaging. The presented case extends the list of SHE-related genes to include TSC1, thus suggesting a central pathogenic role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade dysfunction in SHE and introducing a possible use of mTOR inhibitors in this epileptic syndrome.",

    "issue": "65(4)",
    "pages": "647-57",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nOncogenic Kras-activated robust Mek/Erk signals phosphorylate to the tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc) and deactivates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) suppression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); however, Mek and mTOR inhibitors alone have demonstrated minimal clinical antitumor activity.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe generated transgenic mouse models in which mTOR was hyperactivated either through the Kras/Mek/Erk cascade, by loss of Pten or through Tsc1 haploinsufficiency. Primary cancer cells were isolated from mouse tumours. Oncogenic signalling was assessed in vitro and in vivo, with and without single or multiple targeted molecule inhibition. Transcriptional profiling was used to identify biomarkers predictive of the underlying pathway alterations and of therapeutic response. Results from the preclinical models were confirmed on human material.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReduction of Tsc1 function facilitated activation of Kras/Mek/Erk-mediated mTOR signalling, which promoted the development of metastatic PDACs. Single inhibition of mTOR or Mek elicited strong feedback activation of Erk or Akt, respectively. Only dual inhibition of Mek and PI3K reduced mTOR activity and effectively induced cancer cell apoptosis. Analysis of downstream targets demonstrated that oncogenic activity of the Mek/Erk/Tsc/mTOR axis relied on Aldh1a3 function. Moreover, in clinical PDAC samples, ALDH1A3 specifically labelled an aggressive subtype.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results advance our understanding of Mek/Erk-driven mTOR activation and its downstream targets in PDAC, and provide a mechanistic rationale for effective therapeutic matching for Aldh1a3-positive PDACs.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 is a tumor suppressor that associates with TSC2 to inactivate Rheb, thereby inhibiting signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 stimulates cell growth by promoting anabolic cellular processes, such as translation, in response to growth factors and nutrient signals. To test roles for TSC1 and mTORC1 in β-cell function, we utilized Rip2/Cre to generate mice lacking Tsc1 in pancreatic β-cells (Rip-Tsc1cKO mice). Although obesity developed due to hypothalamic Tsc1 excision in older Rip-Tsc1cKO animals, young animals displayed a prominent gain-of-function β-cell phenotype prior to the onset of obesity. The young Rip-Tsc1cKO animals displayed improved glycemic control due to mTOR-mediated enhancement of β-cell size, mass, and insulin production but not determinants of β-cell number (proliferation and apoptosis), consistent with an important anabolic role for mTOR in β-cell function. Furthermore, mTOR mediated these effects in the face of impaired Akt signaling in β-cells. Thus, mTOR promulgates a dominant signal to promote β-cell/islet size and insulin production, and this pathway is crucial for β-cell function and glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose products form a critical inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Loss of TSC1/2 gene function renders an mTOR-overactivated state. Clinically, TSC manifests with epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and sleep dysfunction. Here, we report that mouse models of TSC have abnormal circadian rhythms. We show that mTOR regulates the proteostasis of the core clock protein BMAL1, affecting its translation, degradation, and subcellular localization. This results in elevated levels of BMAL1 and a dysfunctional clock that displays abnormal timekeeping under constant conditions and exaggerated responses to phase resetting. Genetically lowering the dose of BMAL1 rescues circadian behavioral phenotypes in TSC mouse models. These findings indicate that BMAL1 deregulation is a feature of the mTOR-activated state and suggest a molecular mechanism for mitigating circadian phenotypes in a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is a largely benign tumor syndrome derived from the acquisition of somatic lesions in genes encoding the tumor suppressor products, TSC1 or TSC2. Loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which acts as a Rheb GAP, yields constitutive, unrestrained signaling from the cell growth machinery comprised of Rheb, mTOR, and S6K. We demonstrate herein that constitutive activation of the Rheb/mTOR/S6K cassette, whether by genetic deletion of TSC1 or TSC2 or by ectopic expression of Rheb, is sufficient to induce insulin resistance. This is the result of downregulation of the insulin receptor substrates, IRS1 and IRS2, which become limiting for signal transmission from the insulin receptor to PI3K. Downstream of PI3K, the survival kinase, Akt, is completely refractory to activation by IRS-dependent growth factor pathways such as insulin or IGF-I in TSC1- or TSC2-deficient cells but not to activation by IRS-independent pathways such as those utilized by PDGF. The antiapoptotic program induced by IGF-I but not PDGF is severely compromised in TSC2 null cells. Our results suggest that inappropriate activation of the Rheb/mTOR/S6K pathway imposes a negative feedback program to attenuate IRS-dependent processes such as cell survival.",

    "issue": "42(8)",
    "pages": "2595-612",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cellular growth which associates with other proteins to form two multi-protein complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. Dysregulation of mTORC1 signalling in brain is implicated in neuropathological conditions such as autism spectrum or neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, allosteric mTOR inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of such disorders. Here, we ablated either mTORC1 or mTORC2 conditionally in Purkinje cells of the mouse cerebellum to dissect their role in the development, function and survival of these neurons. We find that the two mouse models largely differ from each other by phenotype and cellular responses. Inactivation of mTORC2, but not of mTORC1, led to motor coordination deficits at an early age. This phenotype correlated with developmental deficits in climbing fibre elimination and impaired dendritic self-avoidance in mTORC2-deficient Purkinje cells. In contrast, inactivation of mTORC1, but not of mTORC2, affected social interest of the mice and caused a progressive loss of Purkinje cells due to apoptosis. This cell loss was paralleled by age-dependent motor deficits. Comparison of mTORC1-deficient Purkinje cells with those deficient for the mTORC1 inhibitor TSC1 revealed a striking overlap in Purkinje cell degeneration and death, which included neurofilamentopathy and reactive gliosis. Altogether, our study reveals distinct roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in Purkinje cells for mouse behaviour and the survival of neurons. Our study also highlights a convergence between the phenotypes of Purkinje cells lacking mTORC1 activity and those expressing constitutively active mTORC1 due to TSC1 deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS) were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1 Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366 patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set (HR adjusted for age, gender, smoking habits, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, histology, and stage [aHR] and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87, Cox P=0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 and 0.36-0.93, Cox P=0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1 gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-directed therapies are the standard of care in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) but are not used based on molecular subclassifications of ccRCC.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if an association exists between genomic alterations (GAs) detected by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in the course of clinical care and the response to anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and anti-MTOR pathway targeted therapies in a cohort of patients with treated mccRCC.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nCGP, using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified platform, was performed on 31 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens (84% from cytoreductive nephrectomies) obtained from patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had received VEGFR and/or mTOR inhibitors. Duration of treatment (DOT) and extent and duration of clinical response were obtained from review of medical records.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nAll classes of GAs-base substitutions, short insertions, deletions, gene fusions, rearrangements, and copy number-were assessed via hybrid capture-based CGP. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequency of GAs in groups segregated by the DOT with VEGF-directed agents.\n\n\nRESULTS AND LIMITATIONS\nThe most common GAs detected in this series were in VHL (70%), PBRM1 (48%), SETD2 (32%), TSC1 (29%), MLL (19%), TERT (16%), ARID1B (16%), and KDM5C (16%). Across 61 administrations of VEGF-directed therapy in 27 patients, exceptional responses (DOT >21 mo) were more frequent among patients with GAs in KDM5C, PBRM1, and VHL. Conversely, these patients also featured a lower frequency of GA associated with response to mTOR-directed therapy, such as TSC1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMolecular subclassifications may affect response to VEGF-directed therapy. The predictive and prognostic nature of these molecular subclassifications in the metastatic setting should be explored in an extended series.\n\n\nPATIENT SUMMARY\nComprehensive genomic profiling in the course of clinical care in the community oncology setting can delineate subgroups of patients with advanced kidney cancer who stand to benefit more from specific molecular-targeted agents.",

    "title": "Double trouble: when sonic hedgehog signaling meets TSC inactivation.",
    "issue": "9(3)",
    "pages": "456-9",
    "abstract": "Certain types of medulloblastoma, the most common solid pediatric cancer, are proposed to arise from neural precursors known as cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs), which require signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) for their proliferation and survival. Aberrant activity of these pathways is implicated in medulloblastoma. IGF activates the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a growth-promoting kinase normally kept in check by the tumor suppressive Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), comprised of TSC1 and TSC2. TSC also counteracts proliferation by stabilizing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), preventing progression through G(1)- to S-phase of the cell cycle. We reported that mice with impaired TSC activity show increased susceptibility to Shh-mediated medulloblastoma. CGNPs and tumors from these mice display increased proliferation, mTOR pathway activation, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) alpha/beta inactivation, and atypical p27(Kip1) cytoplasmic localization. GSK-3alpha/beta inactivation was mTOR-dependent, whereas p27(Kip1) localization was uncoupled from mTOR, and was instead regulated by TSC2. These results provide insight into the molecular 'hardwiring' of the mitogenic network downstream of Shh signaling and emphasize the separate yet synergistic effects regulated by the TSC complex in (1) fueling proliferation through mTOR activation/GSK-3alpha/beta inactivation and (2) compromising checkpoint mechanisms via TSC2-dependent p27(Kip1) nuclear exclusion. Future medulloblastoma therapies targeting Shh signaling can be developed to selectively modulate these activities, to restore checkpoint control and attenuate uncontrolled hyperproliferation.",

    "abstract": "A crucial role for both insulin and mTOR in the regulation of milk protein synthesis is emerging. Bovine mammary biopsies harvested during late-pregnancy through end of subsequent lactation were used to evaluate via quantitative PCR the expression of 44 genes involved in pathways of insulin, mTOR, AMPK, and Jak2-Stat5 signalling and also glucose and amino acid (AA) transporters. We observed an increased expression during lactation of ELF5, AA and glucose transporters, insulin signaling pathway components, MAPK14, FRAP1, EIF4EBP2, GSK3A and TSC1 among mTOR signaling-related genes. Among ribosomal components RPL22 was down-regulated. The overall data support a central role of AA and glucose transporters and insulin signaling through mTOR for the regulation of protein synthesis in bovine mammary gland. Furthermore, the existence of translational competition favoring the translation of milk protein transcripts was inferred from the combined dataset.",

    "pages": "13",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central node in a network of signaling pathways controlling cell growth and survival. This multiprotein complex integrates external signals and affects different nutrient pathways in various organs. However, it is not clear how alterations of mTORC1 signaling in skeletal muscle affect whole-body metabolism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe characterized the metabolic phenotype of young and old raptor muscle knock-out (RAmKO) and TSC1 muscle knock-out (TSCmKO) mice, where mTORC1 activity in skeletal muscle is inhibited or constitutively activated, respectively. Ten-week-old RAmKO mice are lean and insulin resistant with increased energy expenditure, and they are resistant to a high-fat diet (HFD). This correlates with an increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and a downregulation of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Ten-week-old TSCmKO mice are also lean, glucose intolerant with a decreased activation of protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) targets that regulate glucose transporters in the muscle. The mice are resistant to a HFD and show reduced accumulation of glycogen and lipids in the liver. Both mouse models suffer from a myopathy with age, with reduced fat and lean mass, and both RAmKO and TSCmKO mice develop insulin resistance and increased intramyocellular lipid content.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study shows that alterations of mTORC1 signaling in the skeletal muscle differentially affect whole-body metabolism. While both inhibition and constitutive activation of mTORC1 induce leanness and resistance to obesity, changes in the metabolism of muscle and peripheral organs are distinct. These results indicate that a balanced mTORC1 signaling in the muscle is required for proper metabolic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nEpilepsy is one of the most prominent symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder, and may be related to developmental defects resulting from impaired TSC1 or TSC2 gene function in astrocytes and neurons. Inactivation of the Tsc1 gene driven by a glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter during embryonic brain development leads to widespread pathologic effects on astrocytes and neurons, culminating in severe, progressive epilepsy in mice (Tsc1GFAP-Cre mice). However, the developmental timing and cellular specificity relevant to epileptogenesis in this model has not been well defined. The present study evaluates the effect of postnatal Tsc1 gene inactivation on pathologic features of astrocytes and neurons and development of epilepsy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn inducible Tsc1 knock-out mouse was created utilizing a tamoxifen-driven GFAP-CreER line (Tsc1GFAP-CreER mice) with TSC1 reduction induced postnatally at 2 and 6 weeks of age, and compared to conventional Tsc1GFAP-Cre mice with prenatal TSC1 reduction. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, histology, and video-electroencephalography (EEG) assessed mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, astrogliosis, neuronal organization, and spontaneous seizures, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTsc1 gene inactivation at 2 weeks of age was sufficient to cause astrogliosis and mild epilepsy in Tsc1GFAP-CreER mice, but the phenotype was much less severe than that observed with prenatal Tsc1 gene inactivation in Tsc1GFAP-Cre mice. Both astrocytes and neurons were affected by prenatal and postnatal Tsc1 gene activation to a degree similar to the severity of epilepsy, suggesting that both cellular types may contribute to epileptogenesis.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThese findings support a model in which the developmental timing of TSC1 loss dictates the severity of neuronal and glial abnormalities and resulting epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products form a complex that is essential in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. TSC is characterized by the presence of benign tumors called hamartomas, which within the brain are known as cortical tubers. Neurological manifestations in TSC patients include epilepsy, mental retardation, and autistic features. In response to hormones, growth factors, or nutrients, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase-Tsc-mTOR pathways activate the translation machinery and regulate cell growth and/or size. Loss of TSC1 or TSC2 function results in constitutive activation of mTOR leading to tumor formation. Nevertheless, regulation of mTOR activity in nondividing neuronal cells and roles of mTOR hyperactivation in the neurological aspects of TSC remain elusive. Here, we have established a genetic model of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation in culture by using lentiviral vector-mediated TSC2 knockdown, which offers a reliable tool for analyzing the TSC-mTORC1 signaling in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, leads to the development of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a benign tumor syndrome with multiple affected organs. mTORC1-mediated inhibition of AKT constrains the tumor progression of TSC, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Herein we showed that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) expression was mediated by mTORC1. Moreover, mTORC1 inhibited PDGFRα expression via suppression of forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a)-mediated PDGFRα gene transcription. In addition, ectopic expression of PDGFRα promoted AKT activation and enhanced proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of Tsc1- or Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and vice versa. Most importantly, rapamycin in combination with AG1295, a PDGFR inhibitor, significantly inhibited growth of TSC1/TSC2 complex-deficient cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, downregulated FOXO3a/PDGFRα/AKT pathway exerts a protective effect against hyperactivated mTORC1-induced tumorigenesis caused by loss of TSC1/TSC2 complex, and the combination of rapamycin and AG1295 may be a new effective strategy for TSC-associated tumors treatment.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex human disease gene products TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional complex that negatively regulates target of rapamycin (TOR), an evolutionarily conserved kinase that plays a central role in cell growth and metabolism. Here, we describe a novel role of TSC1/2 in controlling stem cell maintenance. We show that in the Drosophila ovary, disruption of either the Tsc1 or Tsc2 gene in germline stem cells (GSCs) leads to precocious GSC differentiation and loss. The GSC loss can be rescued by treatment with TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, or by eliminating S6K, a TORC1 downstream effecter, suggesting that precocious differentiation of Tsc1/2 mutant GSC is due to hyperactivation of TORC1. One well-studied mechanism for GSC maintenance is that BMP signals from the niche directly repress the expression of a differentiation-promoting gene bag of marbles (bam) in GSCs. In Tsc1/2 mutant GSCs, BMP signalling activity is downregulated, but bam expression is still repressed. Moreover, Tsc1 bam double mutant GSCs could differentiate into early cystocytes, suggesting that TSC1/2 controls GSC differentiation via both BMP-Bam-dependent and -independent pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that TSC prevents precocious GSC differentiation by inhibiting TORC1 activity and subsequently differentiation-promoting programs. As TSC1/2-TORC1 signalling is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals, it could have a similar role in controlling stem cell behaviour in mammals, including humans.",

    "pages": "1088-97",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway have antiepileptogenic effects in preventing epilepsy and pathologic and molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, long-term treatment with mTOR inhibitors may be required to maintain efficacy and potentially has chronic side effects, such as immunosuppression. Attempts to minimize drug exposure will facilitate translational efforts to develop mTOR inhibitors as antiepileptogenic agents for patients with TSC. In this study, we tested intermittent dosing paradigms of mTOR inhibitors for antiepileptogenic properties in a TSC mouse model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWestern blot analysis of phosphorylation of S6 protein was used to assess the dose- and time-dependence of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin in control mice and conditional knockout mice with inactivation of the Tsc1 gene in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells (Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice). Based on the Western blot studies, different dosing paradigms of rapamycin starting at postnatal day 21 were tested for their ability to prevent epilepsy or pathologic abnormalities in Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice: 4 days of rapamycin only (4-∞), 4 days on-24 days off (4-24), and 4 days on-10 days off (4-10).\n\n\nRESULTS\nmTOR activity was inhibited by rapamycin in a dose-dependent fashion and recovered to baseline by about 10 days after the last rapamycin dose. The 4-10 and 4-24 dosing paradigms almost completely prevented epilepsy and the 4-10 paradigm inhibited glial proliferation and megalencephaly in Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nIntermittent dosing of rapamycin, with drug holidays of more than 3 weeks, maintains significant antiepileptogenic properties in mouse models of TSC. These findings have important translational applications in developing mTOR inhibitors as antiepileptogenic agents in TSC patients by minimizing drug exposure and potential side effects.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is widely implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Bone homeostasis is maintained by the actions of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. An imbalance in the sophisticated regulation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts leads to the pathogenesis as well as etiology of certain metabolic bone diseases, including osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. Here, we identified mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) as a pivotal mediator in the regulation of bone resorption and bone homeostasis under pathological conditions through its expression in osteoclasts. The activity of mTORC1, which was indicated by the phosphorylation level of its downstream target p70S6 kinase, was reduced during osteoclast differentiation, in accordance with the upregulation of Hamartin (encoded by tuberous sclerosis complex 1 [Tsc1]), a negative regulator of mTORC1. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-dependent osteoclastogenesis was impaired in Tsc1-deficient bone marrow macrophages. By contrast, osteoclastogenesis was markedly enhanced by Raptor deficiency but was unaffected by Rictor deficiency. The deletion of Tsc1 in osteoclast lineage cells in mice prevented bone resorption and bone loss in a RANKL-induced mouse model of osteoporosis, although neither bone volume nor osteoclastic parameter was markedly altered in these knockout mice under physiological conditions. Therefore, these findings suggest that mTORC1 is a key potential target for the treatment of bone diseases.",

    "abstract": "Protein transport plays a critical role in the interaction of the cell with its environment. Recent studies have identified TSC1 and TSC2, two tumor suppressor genes involved in tuberous sclerosis complex, as regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Cells deficient in TSC1 or TSC2 possess high levels of Rheb-GTP resulting in constitutive mTOR activation. We have shown previously that the TSC1/TSC2 complex is involved in post-Golgi transport of VSVG and caveolin-1 in mammalian cells. Here, we show that modulation of mTOR activity affects caveolin-1 localization and that this effect is independent of p70S6K. Tsc1- and Tsc2-null cells exhibit abnormal caveolin-1 localization that is accompanied by disorganized microtubules in the subcortical region. Analyses of green fluorescent protein-EB1 and tubulin in live mutant cells suggest a failure of the plus-ends to sense cortical signals and to halt microtubule growth. Down-regulation of CLIP-170, a putative mTOR substrate with microtubule-binding properties, rescued the abnormal microtubule arrangement and caveolin-1 localization in Tsc2-/- cells. Together, these findings highlight a novel role of the TSC2/mTOR pathway in regulating microtubule-dependent protein transport.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a well-conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that controls autophagy as well as many other processes such as protein synthesis, cell growth, and metabolism. The activity of mTORC1 is stringently and negatively controlled by the tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 complex (TSC1/2).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn contrast to the previous studies using Tsc1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells, we demonstrated evidence that TSC1 deficient macrophages exhibited enhanced basal and mycobacterial infection-induced autophagy via AMPKα-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser555). These effects were concomitant with constitutive activation of mTORC1 and can be reversed by addition of amino acids or rapamycin, and by the knockdown of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Raptor. In addition, increased autophagy in TSC1 deficient macrophages resulted in suppression of inflammation during mycobacterial infection, which was reversed upon amino acid treatment of the TSC1 deficient macrophages. We further demonstrated that TSC1 conditional knockout mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, resulted in less bacterial burden and a comparable level of inflammation when compared to wild type mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data revealed that sustained activation of mTORC1 due to defects in TSC1 promotes AMPKα-dependent autophagic flux to maintain cellular homeostasis.",

In contrast to mTOR or regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) mutants, the inner cell mass of Rheb(-/-) embryos differentiated normally. Nevertheless, Rheb(-/-) embryos died around midgestation, most likely due to impaired development of the cardiovascular system. Rheb(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts showed decreased TORC1 activity, were smaller, and showed impaired proliferation.

    "pages": "ra25",
    "abstract": "The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and is a central regulator of growth and metabolism. Insulin activation of mTORC1, mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and the inhibitory tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1-TSC2), initiates a negative feedback loop that ultimately inhibits PI3K. We present a data-driven dynamic insulin-mTOR network model that integrates the entire core network and used this model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by which insulin regulates mTORC2. By analyzing the effects of perturbations targeting several levels within the network in silico and experimentally, we found that, in contrast to current hypotheses, the TSC1-TSC2 complex was not a direct or indirect (acting through the negative feedback loop) regulator of mTORC2. Although mTORC2 activation required active PI3K, this was not affected by the negative feedback loop. Therefore, we propose an mTORC2 activation pathway through a PI3K variant that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that regulates mTORC1. This putative pathway predicts that mTORC2 would be refractory to Akt, which inhibits TSC1-TSC2, and, indeed, we found that mTORC2 was insensitive to constitutive Akt activation in several cell types. Our results suggest that a previously unknown network structure connects mTORC2 to its upstream cues and clarifies which molecular connectors contribute to mTORC2 activation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that control TLR-induced responses, including endotoxin tolerance, have been not well understood. The tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We show in this study that deficiency of TSC1 results in enhanced activation of not only mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), but also JNK1/2, following LPS stimulation in macrophages. TSC1-deficient macrophages produce elevated proinflammatory cytokines and NO in response to multiple TLR ligands. Such enhanced TLR-induced responses can be inhibited by reducing mTORC1 and JNK1/2 activities with chemical inhibitors or small hairpin RNA, suggesting that TSC1 negatively controls TLR responses through both mTORC1 and JNK1/2. The impact of TSC1 deficiency appeared not limited to TLRs, as NOD- and RIG-I/MDA-5-induced innate responses were also altered in TSC1-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, TSC1 deficiency appears to cause impaired induction of endotoxin tolerance in vitro and in vivo, which is correlated with increased JNK1/2 activation and can be reversed by JNK1/2 inhibition. Our results reveal a critical role of TSC1 in regulating innate immunity by negative control of mTORC1 and JNK1/2 activation.",

These two proteins form a cytosolic complex that inhibits the mTOR pathway that controls cell growth and proliferation. Pathologically, abnormalities of neuronal migration, cellular differentiation and excessive cellular proliferation all contribute to the formation of the different brain lesions of TSC. Seizure is the most common presenting symptom. Seizures can be present in the first year of life and up to one third of children develop infantile spasms. Seizures usually have a focal or multifocal origin, are often resistant to antiepileptic drugs and have a negative impact on the neurocognitive development. Vigabatrin has proved to be effective against infantile spasms due to TSC. New evidence suggests that it is possible to noninvasively identify using multimodality techniques, TSC children who are likely to become seizure-free following surgical treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and the possible role of the mTOR pathway in this process might increase the availability of novel and targeted therapies.",

The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, form a protein complex that inhibits signal transduction to the downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We have developed a straightforward, semiautomated in-cell western (ICW) assay to investigate the effects of amino acid changes on the TSC1-TSC2-dependent inhibition of mTOR activity. Using this assay, we have characterised 20 TSC2 variants identified in individuals with TSC or suspected of having the disease. In 12 cases, we concluded that the identified variant was pathogenic. The ICW is a rapid, reproducible assay, which can be applied to the characterisation of the effects of novel TSC2 variants on the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex.",

    "pages": "3197-3208",
    "abstract": "mTORC1 is a central signaling hub that integrates intra- and extracellular signals to regulate a variety of cellular metabolic processes. Mutations in regulators of mTORC1 lead to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism, which is characterized by repetitive, inflexible behaviors. These behaviors may result from alterations in striatal circuits that control motor learning and habit formation. However, the consequences of mTORC1 dysregulation on striatal neuron function are largely unknown. To investigate this, we deleted the mTORC1 negative regulator Tsc1 from identified striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons and examined how cell-autonomous upregulation of mTORC1 activity affects their morphology and physiology. We find that loss of Tsc1 increases the excitability of striatonigral, but not striatopallidal, neurons and selectively enhances corticostriatal synaptic transmission. These findings highlight the critical role of mTORC1 in regulating striatal activity in a cell type- and input-specific manner, with implications for striatonigral pathway dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are fundamental but complex determinants for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. However, the factors involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we identify sterol regulatory element binding factor-1c (Srebf1c) as a key factor in maintaining HSC biology under both steady-state and stress conditions. Srebf1c knockout (Srebf1c-/-) mice display increased phenotypic HSCs and less HSC quiescence. In addition, Srebf1c deletion compromises the function and survival of HSCs in competitive transplantation or following chemotherapy and irradiation. Mechanistically, SREBF1c restrains the excessive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs by regulating the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1). Our study demonstrates that Srebf1c plays an important role in regulating HSC fate via the TSC1-mTOR-mitochondria axis.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can mediate T-cell survival; however, the role of this pathway in T-cell survival during fungal sepsis is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the mTOR pathway in CD4+ T-cell survival in a mouse model of rapidly progressive lethal sepsis induced by severe invasive candidiasis and explored the possible mechanism. The decrease in CD4+ T-cell survival following fungal sepsis was ameliorated in mice with a T-cell-specific mTOR deletion, whereas it was exacerbated in mice with a T-cell-specific tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 deletion. To explore the mechanism further, we measured expression of autophagy proteins light chain 3B and p62/sequestosome 1 in CD4+ T cells. Both proteins were increased in T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice but lower in T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice had more autophagosomes than wild-type mice following fungal sepsis. CD4+ T-cell mTOR knockout decreased CD4+ T-cell apoptosis in fungal sepsis. Most notably, the T-cell-specific mTOR deletion mice had an increased survival rate after fungal sepsis. These results suggest that the mTOR pathway plays a vital role in CD4+ T-cell survival during fungal sepsis, partly through the autophagy-apoptosis pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGiven the modest responses to everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, in multiple tumor types, there is a pressing need to identify predictive biomarkers for this drug. Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the benign tumor formation in multiple organs. The main etiology of TSC is the loss-of-function mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which leads to aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In this research, we found a significant increase of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) expression in Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with the control cells. Inhibition of mTORC1 led to a dramatic decrease of PFKFB3 expression, indicating PFKFB3 regulation by mTORC1. Moreover, suppression of mTORC1 inhibited the expression of PFKFB3 in rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-null ELT3 cells and human tumor cells. Furthermore, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) as a mediator transmitting the signal from mTORC1 to PFKFB3. Depletion of PFKFB3 inhibited proliferation and tumorigenicity of Tsc1- or Tsc2-deficient cells. In addition, combination of rapamycin with PFK15, a PFKFB3 inhibitor, exerts a stronger inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of Tsc1- or Tsc2-null MEFs than treatment with single drug. We conclude that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 led to upregulated expression of PFKFB3 through activation of mTORC1/HIF-1α signaling pathway and co-administration of rapamycin and PFK15 may be a promising strategy for the treatment of TSC tumors as well as other hyperactivated mTORC1-related tumors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, form a complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1). Here, we investigate the effects of 78 TSC2 variants identified in individuals suspected of TSC, on the function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. According to our functional assessment, 40 variants disrupted the TSC1-TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1. We classified 34 of these as pathogenic, three as probably pathogenic and three as possibly pathogenic. In one case, a likely effect on splicing as well as an effect on function was noted. In 15 cases, our functional assessment did not agree with the predictions of the SIFT amino acid substitution analysis software. Our data support the notion that different, nonterminating TSC2 mutations can have distinct effects on TSC1-TSC2 function, and therefore, on TSC pathology.",

    "issue": "11(8)",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates both intracellular and extracellular signals to regulate cell growth and metabolism. However, the role of mTOR signaling in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is undefined, and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we report that activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is required for preosteoblast proliferation; however, inactivation of mTORC1 is essential for their differentiation and maturation. Inhibition of mTORC1 prevented preosteoblast proliferation, but enhanced their differentiation in vitro and in mice. Activation of mTORC1 by deletion of tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) in preosteoblasts produced immature woven bone in mice due to excess proliferation but impaired differentiation and maturation of the cells. The mTORC1-specific inhibitor, rapamycin, restored these in vitro and in vivo phenotypic changes. Mechanistically, mTORC1 prevented osteoblast maturation through activation of the STAT3/p63/Jagged/Notch pathway and downregulation of Runx2. Preosteoblasts with hyperactive mTORC1 reacquired the capacity to fully differentiate and maturate when subjected to inhibition of the Notch pathway. Together, these findings identified the role of mTORC1 in osteoblast formation and established that mTORC1 prevents preosteoblast differentiation and maturation through activation of the Notch pathway.",

    "issue": "65(24)",
    "pages": "11354-60",
    "abstract": "The metazoan cell cycle is driven by the timely and composite activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Among these, cyclin D- and cyclin E-dependent kinases phosphorylate the pRb family proteins during G(1) phase of the cell cycle and thereby advance cells beyond the restriction point. Increasing evidence suggests that cyclin D-dependent kinases might affect events other than Rb pathway-mediated entry into S phase, such as accumulation of cell mass. However, little is known about cyclin D activity toward Rb-independent pathway(s) or non-pRb substrates. In this article, we show that the tumor suppressor TSC2 is a cyclin D binding protein. Coexpression of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 in cultured cells leads to increased phosphorylation and decreased detection of both TSC2 and TSC1, and promotes the phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates, 4E-BP1 and S6K1, two key effectors of cell growth that are negatively regulated by the TSC1-TSC2 complex. At the cellular level, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 restores the cell size decrease caused by TSC1-TSC2 expression. Intriguingly, down-regulation of TSC proteins was also observed by the expression of a mutant cyclin D1 that is unable to bind to CDK4/6, or by the coexpression of cyclin D1 with either an INK4 inhibitor or with catalytically inactive CDK6, indicating that cyclin D may regulate TSC1-TSC2 independently of CDK4/6. Together, these observations suggest that mammalian D-type cyclins participate in cell growth control through negative regulation of TSC1-TSC2 function.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by mutation in either Tsc1 or Tsc2 genes that leads to the hyper activation of the mTOR pathway, a key signalling pathway for synaptic plasticity. TSC is characterized by benign tumors arising in different organs and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, anxiety and depressive behaviour. Rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of mTOR and its efficacy in treating epilepsy and neurological symptoms remains elusive. In a mouse model in which Tsc1 has been deleted in embryonic telencephalic neural stem cells, we analyzed anxiety- and depression-like behaviour by elevated-plus maze (EPM), open-field test (OFT), forced-swim test (FST) and tail-suspension test (TST), after chronic administration of rapamycin. In addition, spectral analysis of background EEG was performed. Rapamycin-treated mutant mice displayed a reduction in anxiety- and depression-like phenotype, as shown by the EPM/OFT and FST, respectively. These results were inline with EEG power spectra outcomes. The same effects of rapamycin were observed in wild-type mice. Notably, in heterozygous animals we did not observe any EEG and/or behavioural variation after rapamycin treatment. Together these results suggest that both TSC1 deletion and chronic rapamycin treatment might have a role in modulating behaviour and brain activity, and point out to the potential usefulness of background EEG analysis in tracking brain dysfunction in parallel with behavioural testing.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign tumors arising from the abnormal activation of mTOR signaling in cells lacking TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) activity. To expand the genetic framework surrounding this group of growth regulators, we utilized the model eukaryote Schizosaccharomyces pombe to uncover and characterize genes that buffer the phenotypic effects of mutations in the orthologous tsc1 or tsc2 loci. Our study identified two genes: fft3 (encoding a DNA helicase) and ypa1 (encoding a peptidyle-prolyl cis/trans isomerase). While the deletion of fft3 or ypa1 has little effect in wild-type fission yeast cells, their loss in tsc1Δ or tsc2Δ backgrounds results in severe growth inhibition. These data suggest that the inhibition of Ypa1p or Fft3p might represent an 'Achilles' heel' of cells defective in hamartin/tuberin function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction between tsc1/tsc2 and ypa1 can be rescued through treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, torin-1, and that ypa1Δ cells are resistant to the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose. This identifies ypa1 as a novel upstream regulator of mTOR and suggests that the effects of ypa1 loss, together with mTOR activation, combine to result in a cellular maladaptation in energy metabolism that is profoundly inhibitory to growth.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulations in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway are associated with several human anomalies. We aimed to elucidate possible implications for potential aberrations in the mTOR pathway with childhood malnutrition. We analyzed the activity of phospho-mTORC1 and the expressions of several mTOR pathway genes, namely: MTOR, TSC1, LAMTOR2, RPS6K1 and RICTOR from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from venous blood of children suffering from different forms of malnutrition and compared them with those from healthy children. Significant reduction in the phosphorylation of mTORC1 was noted, as well as a decrease in expression of LAMTOR2 gene and increase in TSC1 gene expression were observed between malnourished children in comparison to the healthy children. The deregulation in the activity of the TSC1 and LAMTOR2 gene was significantly associated with all forms of childhood malnutrition. Our findings provide key insights into possible down-modulation in the overall activity of the mTOR pathway in childhood malnutrition. Further studies focusing on the analysis of a multitude of components involved in the mTOR pathway both at the gene and protein expression levels are required for conclusive evidence for the aforementioned proposition.",

    "abstract": "Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is established as an anabolic factor that can induce skeletal muscle growth by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although this signaling pathway has been the subject of much study, the molecular mechanisms linking IGF-1 binding to mTOR activation remain poorly defined in muscle. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that IGF-1 activation of mTOR in C2C12 myotubes requires a phosphorylation-dependent, altered distribution of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/TSC2 complex from the membrane to the cytosol. We found that IGF-1 treatment does not affect complex formation between TSC1 and TSC2, but rather IGF-1 induces an altered distribution of the TSC1/TSC2 complex in C2C12 myotubes. In response to IGF-1 treatment, there was a relative redistribution of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, composed of TSC1 and phosphorylated TSC2, from the membrane to the cytosol. IGF-1-stimulated TSC1/TSC2 phosphorylation and redistribution were completely prevented by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, but were not with the downstream mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. When a nonphosphorylatable form of TSC2 (S939A) was overexpressed, phosphorylation-dependent binding of the scaffold protein 14-3-3 to TSC2 was diminished and no redistribution of the TSC1/TSC2 complex was observed after IGF-1 stimulation. These results indicate that TSC2 phosphorylation in response to IGF-1 treatment is necessary for the altered distribution of the TSC1/TSC2 complex to the cytosol. We suggest that this translocation is likely critical for mTOR activation by dissociating the interaction between the GTPase activating protein activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex and its downstream target, Ras homolog enriched in brain.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex-1 or 2 (TSC1/2) mutations cause white matter abnormalities, including myelin deficits in the CNS; however, underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. TSC1/2 negatively regulate the function of mTOR, which is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Here we report that, unexpectedly, constitutive activation of mTOR signalling by Tsc1 deletion in the oligodendrocyte lineage results in severe myelination defects and oligodendrocyte cell death in mice, despite an initial increase of oligodendrocyte precursors during early development. Expression profiling analysis reveals that Tsc1 ablation induces prominent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses by activating a PERK-eIF2α signalling axis and Fas-JNK apoptotic pathways. Enhancement of the phospho-eIF2α adaptation pathway by inhibition of Gadd34-PP1 phosphatase with guanabenz protects oligodendrocytes and partially rescues myelination defects in Tsc1 mutants. Thus, TSC1-mTOR signalling acts as an important checkpoint for maintaining oligodendrocyte homoeostasis, pointing to a previously uncharacterized ER stress mechanism that contributes to hypomyelination in tuberous sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) is increased under several pathological conditions such as hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Hyperactive mTORC1 and the resulting increased dendritic complexity of neurons are shared molecular and cellular alterations in several neurological disorders associated with cognitive disabilities. Despite some evidence that HIF1a contributes to dendritic overgrowth in vitro, it remains unknown whether increased HIF1a in TSC neurons could contribute to their increased dendritic complexity. To address this use in vivo, we generated TSC neurons by deleting Tsc1 in newborn olfactory bulb (OB) neurons of conditional Tsc1 transgenic mice using neonatal electroporation. In addition to their increased dendritic complexity, Tsc1(null) neurons have been reported to display increased Hif1a mRNA level and HIF1a transcriptional activity. We found that Tsc1(null)-dependent dendritic overgrowth was prevented by knocking down HIF1a or expressing a dominant negative HIF1a. In addition, overexpressing HIF1a in wild-type developing neurons resulted in increased dendritic complexity in vivo. These data highlight that an increase in HIF1a levels contributes to abnormal dendritic patterning in developing neurons under normal conditions and hyperactive mTORC1 conditions as in TSC.",

    "issue": "105(24)",
    "pages": "8286-91",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) assembles a signaling network essential for the regulation of cell growth, which has emerged as a major target of anticancer therapies. The tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) proteins and their target, the small GTPase Rheb, constitute a key regulatory pathway upstream of mTOR. Phospholipase D (PLD) and its product phosphatidic acid are also upstream regulators of the mitogenic mTOR signaling. However, how the TSC/Rheb and PLD pathways interact or integrate in the rapamycin-sensitive signaling network has not been examined before. Here, we find that PLD1, but not PLD2, is required for Rheb activation of the mTOR pathway, as demonstrated by the effects of RNAi. The overexpression of Rheb activates PLD1 in cells in the absence of mitogenic stimulation, and the knockdown of Rheb impairs serum stimulation of PLD activation. Furthermore, the overexpression of TSC2 suppresses PLD1 activation, whereas the knockdown or deletion of TSC2 leads to elevated basal activity of PLD. Consistent with a TSC-Rheb-PLD signaling cascade, AMPK and PI3K, both established regulators of TSC2, appear to lie upstream of PLD as revealed by the effects of pharmacological inhibitors, and serum activation of PLD is also dependent on amino acid sufficiency. Finally, Rheb binds and activates PLD1 in vitro in a GTP-dependent manner, strongly suggesting that PLD1 is a bona fide effector for Rheb. Hence, our findings reveal an unexpected interaction between two cascades in the mTOR signaling pathways and open up additional possibilities for targeting this important growth-regulating network for the development of anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Cervix adenocarcinoma rendered by human papillomavirus (HPV) integration is an aggressive cancer that occurs by dysregulation of multiple pathways, including oncogenes, proto-oncogenes, and tumor suppressors. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which cross-talks with the Ras-ERK pathway, has been associated with cervical cancers (CC), which includes signaling pathways related to carcinoma aggressiveness, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. Since bacterial cyclodipeptides (CDPs) possess cytotoxic properties in HeLa cells with inhibiting Akt/S6k phosphorylation, the mechanism of CDPs cytotoxicity involved was deepened. Results showed that the antiproliferative effect of CDPs occurred by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, inhibiting the mTORC1/mTORC2 complexes in a TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. In addition, the CDPs blocked protein kinases from multiple signaling pathways involved in survival, proliferation, invasiveness, apoptosis, autophagy, and energy metabolism, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2, PI3K/JNK/PKA, p27Kip1/CDK1/survivin, MAPK, HIF-1, Wnt/β-catenin, HSP27, EMT, CSCs, and receptors, such as EGF/ErbB2/HGF/Met. Thus, the antiproliferative effect of the CDPs made it possible to identify the crosstalk of the signaling pathways involved in HeLa cell malignancy and to suggest that bacterial CDPs may be considered as a potential anti-neoplastic drug in human cervical adenocarcinoma therapy.",

    "abstract": "The liver is a key metabolic organ that controls whole-body physiology in response to nutrient availability. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a nutrient-activated kinase and central controller of growth and metabolism that is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1). To investigate the role of hepatic mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in whole-body physiology, we generated liver-specific Tsc1 (L-Tsc1 KO) knockout mice. L-Tsc1 KO mice displayed reduced locomotor activity, body temperature, and hepatic triglyceride content in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Ectopic activation of mTORC1 also caused depletion of hepatic and plasma glutamine, leading to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)-dependent fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression in the liver. Injection of glutamine or knockdown of PGC-1α or FGF21 in the liver suppressed the behavioral and metabolic defects due to mTORC1 activation. Thus, mTORC1 in the liver controls whole-body physiology through PGC-1α and FGF21. Finally, mTORC1 signaling correlated with FGF21 expression in human liver tumors, suggesting that treatment of glutamine-addicted cancers with mTOR inhibitors might have beneficial effects at both the tumor and whole-body level.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed at investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms for patients following cytokine-induced killer (CIK) therapy, particularly involving the alterations in p53-associated signaling pathways, to elucidate whether CIK therapy serves a function in cancer treatment. Samples of blood were collected from patients with breast cancer prior to and following CIK therapy. Two group samples were used for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to determine the alterations in gene expression levels following CIK therapy and one for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), to analyze the reliability of RNA-Seq results. The genes that may encode proteins associated with p53 pathways were selected and analyzed. The expression levels of 8 genes were analyzed, including tumor suppressor protein 53 (TP53), murine double minute homolog 2 (MDM2), ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), sirtuin 1, histone deacetylase 1, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and alterations in expression levels following CIK therapy were determined. However, only RPL11 and RPS23 were identified to exhibit marked alterations in expression levels (FDR <0.05), which was considered to be due to individual distinctions. qPCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of the RPL11, TP53 and TSC1 genes were downregulated, and those of the RPS23 and MDM2 genes were upregulated following CIK therapy. Only MDM2 exhibited a marked alteration in the gene expression level following CIK therapy. Alterations in the expression levels of TP53, RPL11 and TSC1 were associated with those of MDM2, RPS23 and mTOR, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is a multisystem disorder exhibiting a wide range of manifestations characterized by tumour-like lesions called hamartomas in the brain, skin, eyes, heart, lungs and kidneys. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant inheritance and is caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC1/2 genes play a fundamental role in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of the GTPase activity of Rheb. Mutations in TSC1/2 genes impair the inhibitory function of the hamartin/tuberin complex, leading to phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of mTOR, p70 S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 and the elongation factor binding protein 4E-BP1, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and tumourigenesis.Despite recent promising genetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, continuing research in all aspects of this complex disease will be pivotal to decrease its associated morbidity and mortality. In this review we will discuss and analyse all the important findings in the molecular pathogenesis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, focusing on genetics and the molecular mechanisms that define this multisystemic disorder.",

    "issue": "15(2)",
    "pages": "287-97",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2. Hamartin and tuberin, the products of TSC1 and TSC2, respectively, form heterodimers and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin. Previously, we have shown that hamartin is phosphorylated by CDC2/cyclin B1 during the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Here, we report that hamartin is localized to the centrosome and that phosphorylated hamartin and phosphorylated tuberin co-immunoprecipitate with the mitotic kinase Plk1. Plk1 interacts with the N-terminus of hamartin (amino acids 1-880), which contains two potential Plk1-binding sites (T310 and S332). Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 independent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex. A non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant with an alanine substitution at residue T310 does not interact with Plk1, whereas a non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant at residue S332 in conjunction with alanine mutations at the other CDC2/cyclin B1 sites (T417, S584 and T1047) does not impact hamartin binding to Plk1. Hamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1. Finally, Tsc1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased number of centrosomes and increased DNA content, compared to Tsc1(+/+) cells. Both phenotypes are rescued after pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. RNAi inhibition of Plk1 in Tsc1(-/-) MEFs failed to rescue the increased centrosome number phenotype. These data reveal a novel subcellular localization for hamartin and a novel interaction partner for the hamartin/tuberin complex and implicate hamartin and mTOR in the regulation of centrosome duplication.",

    "title": "Neuronal CTGF/CCN2 negatively regulates myelination in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex.",
    "issue": "214(3)",
    "pages": "681-697",
    "abstract": "Disruption of myelination during development has been implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC patients with autism display impairments in white matter integrity. Similarly, mice lacking neuronal Tsc1 have a hypomyelination phenotype. However, the mechanisms that underlie these phenotypes remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal TSC1/2 orchestrates a program of oligodendrocyte maturation through the regulated secretion of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). We characterize oligodendrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. We find that neuron-specific Tsc1 deletion results in an increase in CTGF secretion that non-cell autonomously stunts oligodendrocyte development and decreases the total number of oligodendrocytes. Genetic deletion of CTGF from neurons, in turn, mitigates the TSC-dependent hypomyelination phenotype. These results show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in neurons regulates CTGF production and secretion, revealing a paracrine mechanism by which neuronal signaling regulates oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in TSC. This study highlights the role of mTOR-dependent signaling between neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the regulation of myelin and identifies an additional therapeutic avenue for this disease.",

    "title": "Impaired autophagy in neurons after disinhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin and its contribution to epileptogenesis.",
    "issue": "32(45)",
    "pages": "15704-14",
    "abstract": "Certain mutations within the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, most notably those affecting the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and result in a high incidence of epilepsy in humans and animal models. Although hyperactivation of mTOR has been strongly linked to the development of epilepsy and, conversely, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin treatment is protective against seizures in several models, the downstream epileptic mechanisms have remained elusive. Autophagy, a catabolic process that plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis by mediating the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents, is negatively regulated by mTOR. Here we demonstrate that autophagy is suppressed in brain tissues of forebrain-specific conditional TSC1 and phosphatase and tensin homlog knock-out mice, both of which display aberrant mTOR activation and seizures. In addition, we also discovered that autophagy is suppressed in the brains of human TSC patients. Moreover, conditional deletion of Atg7, an essential regulator of autophagy, in mouse forebrain neurons is sufficient to promote development of spontaneous seizures. Thus, our study suggests that impaired autophagy contributes to epileptogenesis, which may be of interest as a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy treatment and/or prevention.",

Here, we show that N-formyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-benzylidene-gamma-butyrolaetam (KNK437), which inhibits the expression level of Hsp70, abrogated phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K in response to insulin, and inhibited mTORC1 activity via disruption of an interaction between mTOR and raptor. In addition, KNK437 did not alter TSC1/2 complex formation. Furthermore, KNK437 inhibited the mTOR-raptor interaction on the outer membrane of the mitochondria and triggered caspase-3 activation. A reduction in the level of Hsp70 could result in the inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis.",

    "issue": "26(17)",
    "pages": "3303-3312",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTOR inhibitors are now considered the treatment of choice for TSC disease. A major pathological feature of TSC is the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in the brain. Nowadays, it is thought that SEGAs could be a consequence of aberrant aggregation and migration of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Therefore, reactivation of cell migration of NSPCs might be the crucial step for the treatment of patients. In order to identify potential in vitro targets activating migration, we generated Tsc1-deficient NSPCs. These cells summarize most of the biochemical and morphological characteristics of TSC neural cells, such as the mTORC1 activation, the formation of abnormally enlarged astrocytes-like cells, the reduction of autophagy flux and the impairment of cell migration. Moreover, nuclear translocation, namely activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) was markedly impaired. Herein, we show that compounds such as everolimus, ionomycin and curcumin, which directly or indirectly stimulate TFEB nuclear translocation, restore Tsc1-deficient NSPC migration. Our data suggest that reduction of TFEB activation, caused by mTORC1 hyperactivation, contributes to the migration deficit characterizing Tsc1-deficient NSPCs. The present work highlights TFEB as a druggable protein target for SEGAs therapy, which can be additionally or alternatively exploited for the mTORC1-directed inhibitory approach.",

    "pages": "919-931",
    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. However, the precise underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Although accumulating evidence suggests that mTORC1 signaling is regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), whether miRNAs are involved in the tumorigenesis mediated by mTORC1 dysregulation remains largely unclear. In our study, the comparison between tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) -/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the control cells revealed the involvement of microRNA-125b-5p (miR-125b-5p) in the tumorigenesis driven by mTORC1 activation. Our study also showed that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 led to significant downregulation of miR-125b-5p and upregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) via mTORC1 activation. Overexpression of miR-125b-5p inhibited the proliferation of the cells with hyperactivated mTORC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is a direct target of miR-125b-5p. Depletion of STAT3 mimicked the effect of ectopic expression of miR-125b-5p, and reintroduction of STAT3 rescued the compromised cell proliferation driven by miR-125b-5p overexpression in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- MEFs. We conclude that the miR-125b-5p/STAT3 pathway plays a crucial role in hyperactivated mTORC1-mediated tumorigenesis and miR-125b-5p is a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by mutation in either the tsc1 or tsc2 tumor suppressor genes. TSC1 and TSC2 protein form a physical and functional complex in vivo. Recent studies have demonstrated that TSC2 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity specifically toward the small G protein Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) and inhibits its ability to stimulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. We have presented three methods to determine the activity of TSC2 as a GAP toward the Rheb GTPase. The first involves the isolation of TSC2 from cells and measurement of its activity toward Rheb substrate in vitro. The second involves the measurement of Rheb-associated guanine nucleotides as measure of TSC2 GAP activity on Rheb in vivo. The last method is to determine the phosphorylation of S6K1 (ribosomal S6 kinase), which is a downstream target of mTOR, as an indirect assay for TSC2 GAP activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin, a gastric hormone, provides a hunger signal to the central nervous system to stimulate food intake. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular fuel sensor critical for cellular energy homeostasis. Here we showed the reciprocal relationship of gastric mTOR signaling and ghrelin during changes in energy status. mTOR activity was down-regulated, whereas gastric preproghrelin and circulating ghrelin were increased by fasting. In db/db mice, gastric mTOR signaling was enhanced, whereas gastric preproghrelin and circulating ghrelin were decreased. Inhibition of the gastric mTOR signaling by rapamycin stimulated the expression of gastric preproghrelin and ghrelin mRNA and increased plasma ghrelin in both wild-type and db/db mice. Activation of the gastric mTOR signaling by l-leucine decreased the expression of gastric preproghrelin and the level of plasma ghrelin. Overexpression of mTOR attenuated ghrelin promoter activity, whereas inhibition of mTOR activity by overexpression of TSC1 or TSC2 increased its activity. Ghrelin receptor antagonist d-Lys-3-GH-releasing peptide-6 abolished the rapamycin-induced increment in food intake despite that plasma ghrelin remained elevated. mTOR is therefore a gastric fuel sensor whose activity is linked to the regulation of energy intake through ghrelin.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical sensor for bone homeostasis and bone formation; however, the role of mTORC1 in osteoclast development and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully established. Here, we found that mTORC1 activity declined during osteoclast precursors differentiation in vitro and in vivo. We further targeted deletion of Raptor (mTORC1 key component) or Tsc1 (mTORC1 negative regulator) to constitutively inhibit or activate mTORC1 in osteoclast precursors (monocytes/macrophages), using LyzM-cre mice. Osteoclastic formation was drastically increased in cultures of Raptor deficient bone marrow monocytes/macrophages (BMMs), and Raptor-deficient mice displayed osteopenia with enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Conversely, BMMs lacking Tsc1 exhibited a severe defect in osteoclast-like differentiation and absorptive function, both of which were restored following rapamycin treatment. Importantly, expression of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), transcription factors that are essential for osteoclast differentiation was negatively regulated by mTORC1 in osteoclast lineages. These results provide evidence that mTORC1 plays as a critical role as an osteoclastic differentiation-limiting signal and suggest a potential drawback in treating bone loss-related diseases with mTOR inhibitors clinically. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, which presents a serious public health crisis in China nowadays. It has been well recognized that excessive β-cell apoptosis is the key pathogenesis of diabetes, of which the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) serves as the critical signaling pathway. Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency acts as a potential risk factor for diabetes. The present study aims to test the hypothesis that 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1, 25(OH)2D3] can inhibit β-cell apoptosis via the suppression of mTOR signaling pathway. β-cells (INS-1) were cultured in the context of normal glucose or high glucose media with or without 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment. β-cell apoptosis was evaluated by inverted fluorescence microscope, flow cytometry and electron microscope, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to assess the possible perturbations in mTOR signaling pathway. High glucose significantly increased β-cell apoptosis. Of importance, RT-PCR and Western blotting demonstrated that high glucose inhibited DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) and TSC1/TSC2, up-regulated Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K and enhanced expression of the apoptosis regulating proteins, such as phospho-Bcl-2, cytochrome C and cleaved caspase. Interestingly, 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment reversed high glucose induced pathological changes in mTOR signaling pathway, restored expression of DDIT4 and TSC1/TSC2, blocked aberrant up-regulation of Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K and the apoptosis regulating proteins, and effectively inhibited β-cell apoptosis. Therefore, 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment can effectively protects β cell against high glucose-induced apoptosis mainly via the suppression of mTOR signaling pathway, which may be considered as a potential therapy for patients with diabetes.",

    "title": "Timing of mTOR activation affects tuberous sclerosis complex neuropathology in mouse models.",
    "issue": "6(5)",
    "pages": "1185-97",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominantly inherited disease with high penetrance and morbidity, and is caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2. Most affected individuals display severe neurological manifestations - such as intractable epilepsy, mental retardation and autism - that are intimately associated with peculiar CNS lesions known as cortical tubers (CTs). The existence of a significant genotype-phenotype correlation in individuals bearing mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 is highly controversial. Similar to observations in humans, mouse modeling has suggested that a more severe phenotype is associated with mutation in Tsc2 rather than in Tsc1. However, in these mutant mice, deletion of either gene was achieved in differentiated astrocytes. Here, we report that loss of Tsc1 expression in undifferentiated radial glia cells (RGCs) early during development yields the same phenotype detected upon deletion of Tsc2 in the same cells. Indeed, the same aberrations in cortical cytoarchitecture, hippocampal disturbances and spontaneous epilepsy that have been detected in RGC-targeted Tsc2 mutants were observed in RGC-targeted Tsc1 mutant mice. Remarkably, thorough characterization of RGC-targeted Tsc1 mutants also highlighted subventricular zone (SVZ) disturbances as well as STAT3-dependent and -independent developmental-stage-specific defects in the differentiation potential of ex-vivo-derived embryonic and postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs). As such, deletion of either Tsc1 or Tsc2 induces mostly overlapping phenotypic neuropathological features when performed early during neurogenesis, thus suggesting that the timing of mTOR activation is a key event in proper neural development.",

    "pages": "1871-80",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nIndividuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) frequently have intractable epilepsy. To gain insights into mechanisms of epileptogenesis in TSC, we previously developed a mouse model of TSC with conditional inactivation of the Tsc1 gene in glia (Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice). These mice develop progressive seizures, suggesting that glial dysfunction may be involved in epileptogenesis in TSC. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that impairment of potassium uptake through astrocyte inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels may contribute to epileptogenesis in Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nKir channel function and expression were examined in cultured Tsc1-deficient astrocytes. Kir mRNA expression was analyzed in astrocytes microdissected from neocortical sections of Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice. Physiological assays of astrocyte Kir currents and susceptibility to epileptiform activity induced by increased extracellular potassium were further studied in situ in hippocampal slices.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCultured Tsc1-deficient astrocytes exhibited reduced Kir currents and decreased expression of specific Kir channel protein subunits, Kir2.1 and Kir6.1. mRNA expression of the same Kir subunits also was reduced in astrocytes from neocortex of Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice. By using pharmacologic modulators of signalling pathways implicated in TSC, we showed that the impairment in Kir channel function was not affected by rapamycin inhibition of the mTOR/S6K pathway, but was reversed by decreasing CDK2 activity with roscovitine or retinoic acid. Last, hippocampal slices from Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice exhibited decreased astrocytic Kir currents, as well as increased susceptibility to potassium-induced epileptiform activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImpaired extracellular potassium uptake by astrocytes through Kir channels may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis in a mouse model of TSC.",

    "issue": "180(11)",
    "pages": "7582-9",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a mediator of cell growth, survival, and energy metabolism at least partly through its ability to regulate mRNA translation. mTOR is activated downstream of growth factors such as insulin, cytokines such as TNF, and Akt-dependent signaling associated with oncoprotein expression. mTOR is negatively controlled by the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), and activation of Akt induces phosphorylation of TSC2, which blocks the repressive TSC1/2 activity. Previously, we showed that activation of mTOR in PTEN-deficient cancer cells involves IkappaB kinase (IKK) alpha, a catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that controls NF-kappaB activation. Recently, a distinct IKK subunit, IKKbeta, was shown to phosphorylate TSC1 to promote mTOR activation in an Akt-independent manner in certain cells stimulated with TNF and in some cancer cells. In this study, we have explored the involvement of both IKKalpha and IKKbeta in insulin- and TNF-induced mTOR activation. Insulin activation of mTOR requires Akt in a manner that involves IKKalpha, preferentially to IKKbeta, and TSC2 phosphorylation. TNF, in most cells examined, activates Akt to use IKKalpha to control mTOR activation. In MCF7 cells, TNF does not activate Akt and requires IKKbeta to activate mTOR. The results show that Akt-dependent signaling, induced by cytokines or insulin, alters the IKK subunit-dependent control of mTOR.",

    "issue": "19(6)",
    "pages": "839-46",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a progressive lung disease characterized by a diffuse proliferation of pulmonary smooth muscle cells and cystic degeneration. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis can occur either independently of other disease or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex, a tumor-suppressor gene syndrome caused by mutations that inactivate either TSC1 or TSC2. TSC2 mutations and loss of heterozygosity have been identified in sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomas, thus implicating the TSC/Ras homolog-enriched in brain (Rheb)/mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase signaling pathway in their pathogenesis. This study was undertaken to determine whether the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase signaling pathway is activated in lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomas lacking TSC1/TSC2 loss of heterozygosity. Phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) immunohistochemistry was performed on five lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomas, two matched lymphangioleiomyomatosis pulmonary samples, and three sporadic angiomyolipomas. TSC1/TSC2 loss of heterozygosity was previously excluded in these angiomyolipomas. Moderate or strong phospho-ribosomal protein S6 immunoreactivity was found in all lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated and sporadic angiomyolipomas, suggesting a high incidence of mTOR/p70 S6 kinase signaling pathway activation despite a lack of TSC1/TSC2 loss of heterozygosity. Focally positive phospho-S6 staining was also evident in both lymphangioleiomyomatosis pulmonary samples. We hypothesized that this S6 hyperphosphorylation could reflect mutational activation of Rheb or Rheb-like protein (RhebL1), Ras family members which directly activate mTOR. Mutational analysis performed on DNA from these eight angiomyolipomas plus five additional sporadic angiomyolipomas did not reveal mutations in exons 3 and 4 (homologous sites of Ras activating mutations) of either Rheb or RhebL1. These data suggest that activation of the Rheb/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway is related to the pathogenesis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis-associated and sporadic angiomyolipomas lacking TSC1/TSC2 loss of heterozygosity. This high incidence of mTOR signaling pathway activation suggests that treatment with mTOR inhibitors, such as Rapamycin, may benefit patients with angiomyolipomas independent of the detection of TSC1/TSC2 loss of heterozygosity.",

    "abstract": "Target of Rapamycin (TOR) mediates a signalling pathway that couples amino acid availability to S6 kinase (S6K) activation, translational initiation and cell growth. Here, we show that tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) and Tsc2, tumour suppressors that are responsible for the tuberous sclerosis syndrome, antagonize this amino acid-TOR signalling pathway. We show that Tsc1 and Tsc2 can physically associate with TOR and function upstream of TOR genetically. In Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells, loss of Tsc1 and Tsc2 results in a TOR-dependent increase of S6K activity. Furthermore, although S6K is normally inactivated in animal cells in response to amino acid starvation, loss of Tsc1-Tsc2 renders cells resistant to amino acid starvation. We propose that the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex antagonizes the TOR-mediated response to amino acid availability. Our studies identify Tsc1 and Tsc2 as regulators of the amino acid-TOR pathway and provide a new paradigm for how proteins involved in nutrient sensing function as tumour suppressors.",

Inactive mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of αB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis nodules. αB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling cascade. The augmented αB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of αB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced αB-crystallin has an essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and inhibition of αB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGhrelin, the only identified circulating orexigenic signal, is unique in structure in which a specific acyl-modification of its third serine occurs. This acylation is necessary for ghrelin to bind to its receptor and to exert its biologic activity, which is catalyzed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT). Although ghrelin is mainly secreted from gastric X/A like endocrine cells, it is also expressed in pancreatic islet cells and regulates insulin secretion. In this study, we examined the expression and regulation of GOAT in pancreas.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGOAT mRNA and immunoreactivity were examined in pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining or Western blotting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInsulin inhibits the expression of GOAT mRNA and GOAT promoter activity in a dose and time-dependent manner. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is activated by insulin. Blocking mTOR signaling by either rapamycin or overexpression of its negative regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 attenuates the inhibitory effect of insulin on the transcription and translation of GOAT.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study suggests that GOAT is present in pancreatic islet cells and that insulin inhibits the expression of GOAT via the mediation of mTOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "The role of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancers remains largely unknown. The present study shows that neurogenin 3 directed Cre deletion of Tsc1 gene induces the development of pancreatic acinar carcinoma. By cross-breeding the Neurog3-cre mice with Tsc1 (loxp/loxp) mice, we generated the Neurog3-Tsc1-/- transgenic mice in which Tsc1 gene is deleted and mTOR signaling activated in the pancreatic progenitor cells. All Neurog3-Tsc1-/- mice developed notable adenocarcinoma-like lesions in pancreas starting from the age of 100 days old. The tumor lesions are composed of cells with morphological and molecular resemblance to acinar cells. Metastasis of neoplasm to liver and lung was detected in 5% of animals. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the growth of the neoplasm. Relapse of the neoplasm occurred within 14 days upon cessation of rapamycin treatment. Our studies indicate that activation of mTOR signaling in the pancreatic progenitor cells may trigger the development of acinar carcinoma. Thus, mTOR may serve as a potential target for treatment of pancreatic acinar carcinoma.",

The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, form a protein complex that inhibits signal transduction to the downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Recently it has been shown that missense mutations to the TSC1 gene can cause TSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe have used in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the effects on TSC1 function of TSC1 missense variants submitted to the Leiden Open Variation Database.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified specific substitutions between amino acids 50 and 190 in the N-terminal region of TSC1 that result in reduced steady state levels of the protein and lead to increased mTOR signalling.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results suggest that amino acid residues within the N-terminal region of TSC1 are important for TSC1 function and for maintaining the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays critical roles in skeletal development. The impact and underlying mechanisms of its dysregulation in bone homeostasis is poorly defined. The best known and characterized mTOR signaling dysregulation in human disease is called Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome with a high frequency (>66%) of osseous manifestations such as sclerotic lesions in the craniofacial region. TSC is caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2, the heterodimer protein inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling. The underlying mechanism of bone lesions in TSC is unclear. We generated a TSC mouse model with TSC1 deletion in neural crest derived (NCD) cells, which recapitulated the sclerotic craniofacial bone lesion in TSC patients. We demonstrated that TSC1 null NCD osteoblasts overpopulated the NCD bones and the resultant increased bone formation is responsible for the sclerotic bone phenotype. Mechanistically, osteoblast number increase is due to the hyperproliferation of osteoprogenitor cells at an early postnatal stage. Noteworthy, administration of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor at early postnatal stage can completely rescue the excess bone acquisition, but late treatment cannot. Altogether, our data suggested that enhanced mTORC1 signaling in NCD cells can enlarge the osteoprogenitor pool and lead to the excess bone acquisition, which is likely the underlying mechanism of sclerotic bone lesion observed in TSC patients.",

Although this signaling network is frequently altered in cancer, the underlying mechanisms that cause tumorigenesis as a result of activated mTOR remain largely unknown. We report here that expression of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), a critical enzymatic activator of glycolysis, was upregulated in an mTOR-dependent manner in TSC1(-/-), TSC2(-/-), PTEN(-/-), or activated AKT1-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). LDHB gene expression was transactivated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a key tumorigenic driver in many cancers, acting as a downstream mTOR effector in both mouse MEFs and human cancer cells. LDHB attenuation blunted the tumorigenic potential of oncogenic TSC2-null cells in nude mice. We concluded that LDHB is a downstream target of mTOR that is critical for oncogenic mTOR-mediated tumorigenesis. Our findings offer proof of concept for targeting LDHB as a therapeutic strategy in cancers driven by aberrant activation of the RTK-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and frequently results in prominent CNS manifestations, including epilepsy, mental retardation, and autism spectrum disorder. The TSC1/TSC2 protein complex plays a major role in controlling the Ser/Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a master regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. In this study, we show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulates TSC1/TSC2 complex to limit mTOR activity. In addition, Tsc2-deficient rat hippocampal neurons and brain lysates from a Tsc1-deficient mouse model demonstrate both elevated ER and oxidative stress. In Tsc2-deficient neurons, the expression of stress markers such as CHOP and HO-1 is increased, and this increase is completely reversed by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin both in vitro and in vivo. Neurons lacking a functional TSC1/TSC2 complex have increased vulnerability to ER stress-induced cell death via the activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Importantly, knockdown of CHOP reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis in Tsc2-deficient neurons. These observations indicate that ER stress modulates mTOR activity through the TSC protein complex and that ER stress is elevated in cells lacking this complex. They also suggest that some of the neuronal dysfunction and neurocognitive deficits seen in TSC patients may be attributable to ER and oxidative stress and therefore potentially responsive to agents moderating these pathways.",

    "issue": "282(3)",
    "pages": "1757-68",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms regulating initiation of mRNA translation for the generation of protein products that mediate interferon (IFN) responses are largely unknown. We have previously shown that both Type I and II IFNs engage the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in downstream phosphorylation and deactivation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1). In the current study, we provide direct evidence that such regulation of 4E-BP1 by IFNalpha or IFNgamma results in sequential dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and subsequent formation of a functional complex between eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and eukaryotic initiation factor-4G, to allow initiation of mRNA translation. We also demonstrate that the induction of key IFNalpha- or IFNgamma-inducible proteins (ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) and CXCL10) that mediate IFN responses are enhanced in 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1(-/-)) knockout MEFs, as compared with wild-type 4E-BP1(+/+) MEFs. On the other hand, IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation of the Isg15 and Cxcl10 genes is intact in the absence of 4E-BP1, as determined by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR assays and promoter assays for ISRE and GAS, establishing that 4E-BP1 plays a selective negative regulatory role in IFN-induced mRNA translation. Interestingly, the induction of expression of ISG15 and CXCL10 proteins by IFNs was also strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of the tuberin (TSC2(-/-)) or hamartin (TSC1(-/-)) genes, consistent with the known negative regulatory effect of the TSC1-TSC2 complex on mTOR activation. In other work, we demonstrate that the induction of an IFN-dependent antiviral response is strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of 4E-BP1 and TSC2, demonstrating that these elements of the IFN-activated mTOR pathway exhibit important regulatory effects in the generation of IFN responses. Taken altogether, our data suggest an important role for mTOR-dependent pathways in IFN signaling and identify 4E-BP1 and TSC1-TSC2 as key components in the generation of IFN-dependent biological responses.",

    "issue": "35(6)",
    "pages": "3341-51",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive, rare interstitial lung disease that almost exclusively affects women. It is caused by a mutation in one of the tuberous sclerosis genes, TSC1 or TSC2, and constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells). The heightened proliferation and accumulation of LAM cells leads to the destruction of lung tissue.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn the present study, we developed a cell line (S-LAM1) derived from a chylous effusion obtained from a patient with sporadic, pulmonary LAM and evaluated its phenotype using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and an image stream system. Ultrastructure was assessed using a transmission electron microscope. To assess the ability of LAM cells to move and migrate (which is strictly associated with the ability to metastasize), we carried-out a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array analysis of 84 genes involved in cell motility. In order to evaluate the effect of rapamycin, a natural inhibitor of mTOR kinase, on S-LAM1 cells, a sulforhodamine B cell viability assay was performed with different concentrations of rapamycin.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nThe phenotype of these cells is consistent with the biology of LAM cells. S-LAM1 cells present combined smooth muscle, melanocytic, and lymphatic endothelium lineage, as well as the presence of mesenchymal differentiation markers. A particular pattern of gene expression, including high expression of ezrin (EZR), myosin heavy chain 10, non-muscle (MYH10), and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) and a greatly decreased expression of supervillin (SVIL), when compared to controls, indicates a high potential motility activity, especially of cell spreading. Rapamycin significantly, although only partially, inhibited S-LAM1 cell proliferation in vitro, and should, perhaps, be considered in the future in combination with other agents.",

    "issue": "35(3)",
    "pages": "361-375",
    "abstract": "Low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) has been recently proposed as a unique renal tumor. However, we have encountered tumors with more oncocytoma-like morphology that show diffuse keratin 7 reactivity, which we sought to characterize molecularly. Eighteen tumors with a diffuse keratin 7 positive and KIT negative pattern were identified from 184 with predominantly oncocytoma-like histology. These tumors were subjected to detailed immunohistochemical evaluation and 14 were evaluated using the Illumina® HiSeq 4000 platform for 324 cancer-associated genes. Patients' ages ranged from 39 to 80 (median = 59.5 years) with a male to female ratio of 1.25:1. Morphology was predominantly oncocytoma-like with discrete nests, compared to the solid and edematous patterns described in LOT. Other than positive keratin 7 and negative KIT, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8, E-cadherin, AE1/AE3, Ber-EP4, AMACR, CD10, and MOC31, and were negative for other studied markers. FH and INI1 were normal. Eleven of 14 harbored genomic abnormalities, likely sporadic, primarily involving the MTOR pathway (73%). Overall, the alterations included MTOR activating mutation (n = 1), TSC1 inactivating mutation (n = 1), TSC2 mutation (p.X534 splice site, n = 1), STK11 (a negative regulator of the MTOR pathway) mutation (n = 1), both STK11 and TSC1 mutations (n = 1), biallelic loss of PTEN and TSC1 deletion (n = 1), and MET amplification and TSC1 inactivating mutation (n = 1). Amplification of FGFR3 was identified in one additional tumor. Other alterations included FOXP1 loss (n = 1), NF2 E427 homozygous loss (n = 1), and PI3KCA activating mutation (n = 1). At a median follow-up of 68 months (2-147 months) for 15 patients, all were alive without disease. Oncocytic renal tumors with diffuse keratin 7 labeling show frequent alterations in the TSC/MTOR pathway, despite more oncocytoma-like morphology than initially described in LOT, likely expanding the morphologic spectrum of the latter.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex is a key regulator of autophagy, cell growth and proliferation. Here, we studied the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on mTOR activation in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured in high glucose concentration. AVP induced the mTOR phosphorylation in A-10 cells grown in high glucose, in contrast to cells cultured in normal glucose; wherein, only basal phosphorylation was observed. The AVP-induced mTOR phosphorylation was inhibited by a PI3K inhibitor. Moreover, the AVP-induced mTOR activation inhibited autophagy and increased thymidine incorporation in cells grown in high glucose. This increase was abolished by rapamycin which inhibits the mTORC1 complex formation. Our results suggest that AVP stimulates mTOR phosphorylation by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and, subsequently, inhibits autophagy and raises cell proliferation in A-10 cells maintained in high glucose concentration.",

    "issue": "20(3)",
    "pages": "445-54",
    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant, multi-system disorder, typically involving severe neurological symptoms, such as epilepsy, cognitive deficits and autism. Two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, encoding the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have been identified as causing TSC. Although there is a substantial overlap in the clinical phenotype produced by TSC1 and TSC2 mutations, accumulating evidence indicates that TSC2 mutations cause more severe neurological manifestations than TSC1 mutations. In this study, the neurological phenotype of a novel mouse model involving conditional inactivation of the Tsc2 gene in glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (Tsc2(GFAP1)CKO mice) was characterized and compared with previously generated Tsc1(GFAP1)CKO mice. Similar to Tsc1(GFAP1)CKO mice, Tsc2(GFAP1)CKO mice exhibited epilepsy, premature death, progressive megencephaly, diffuse glial proliferation, dispersion of hippocampal pyramidal cells and decreased astrocyte glutamate transporter expression. However, Tsc2(GFAP1)CKO mice had an earlier onset and higher frequency of seizures, as well as significantly more severe histological abnormalities, compared with Tsc1(GFAP1)CKO mice. The differences between Tsc1(GFAP1)CKO and Tsc2(GFAP1)CKO mice were correlated with higher levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in Tsc2(GFAP1)CKO mice and were reversed by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. These findings provide novel evidence in mouse models that Tsc2 mutations intrinsically cause a more severe neurological phenotype than Tsc1 mutations and suggest that the difference in phenotype may be related to the degree to which Tsc1 and Tsc2 inactivation causes abnormal mTOR activation.",

    "pages": "296-306",
    "abstract": "Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common comorbidities of one another. Despite the prevalent correlation between the two disorders, few studies have been able to elucidate a mechanistic link. We demonstrate that forebrain specific Tsc1 deletion in mice causes epilepsy and autism-like behaviors, concomitant with disruption of 5-HT neurotransmission. We find that epileptiform activity propagates to the raphe nuclei, resulting in seizure-dependent hyperactivation of mTOR in 5-HT neurons. To dissect whether mTOR hyperactivity in 5-HT neurons alone was sufficient to recapitulate an autism-like phenotype we utilized Tsc1flox/flox;Slc6a4-cre mice, in which mTOR is restrictively hyperactivated in 5-HT neurons. Tsc1flox/flox;Slc6a4-cre mice displayed alterations of the 5-HT system and autism-like behaviors, without causing epilepsy. Rapamycin treatment in these mice was sufficient to rescue the phenotype. We conclude that the spread of seizure activity to the brainstem is capable of promoting hyperactivation of mTOR in the raphe nuclei, which in turn promotes autism-like behaviors. Thus our study provides a novel mechanism describing how epilepsy can contribute to the development of autism-like behaviors, suggesting new therapeutic strategies for autism.",

    "issue": "292(50)",
    "pages": "20528-20543",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a fatal lung disease associated with germline or somatic inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex genes (TSC1 or TSC2). LAM is characterized by neoplastic growth of smooth muscle-α-actin-positive cells that destroy lung parenchyma and by the formation of benign renal neoplasms called angiolipomas. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin slows progression of these diseases but is not curative and associated with notable toxicity at clinically effective doses, highlighting the need for better understanding LAM's molecular etiology. We report here that LAM lesions and angiomyolipomas overexpress urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressed higher uPA levels than their WT counterparts, resulting from the TSC inactivation. Inhibition of uPA expression in Tsc2-null cells reduced the growth and invasiveness and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. However, rapamycin further increased uPA expression in TSC2-null tumor cells and immortalized TSC2-null angiomyolipoma cells, but not in cells with intact TSC. Induction of glucocorticoid receptor signaling or forkhead box (FOXO) 1/3 inhibition abolished the rapamycin-induced uPA expression in TSC-compromised cells. Moreover, rapamycin-enhanced migration of TSC2-null cells was inhibited by the uPA inhibitor UK122, dexamethasone, and a FOXO inhibitor. uPA-knock-out mice developed fewer and smaller TSC2-null lung tumors, and introduction of uPA shRNA in tumor cells or amiloride-induced uPA inhibition reduced tumorigenesis in vivo These findings suggest that interference with the uPA-dependent pathway, when used along with rapamycin, might attenuate LAM progression and potentially other TSC-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is hyperactivated in many human tumors, including hamartomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Several small molecules such as LY294002 inhibit mTOR kinase activity, but they also inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) at similar concentrations. Compound 401 is a synthetic inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that also targets mTOR but not PI3K in vitro (Griffin, R. J., Fontana, G., Golding, B. T., Guiard, S., Hardcastle, I. R., Leahy, J. J., Martin, N., Richardson, C., Rigoreau, L., Stockley, M., and Smith, G. C. (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48, 569-585). We used 401 to test the cellular effect of mTOR inhibition without the complicating side effects on PI3K. Treatment of cells with 401 blocked the phosphorylation of sites modified by mTOR-Raptor and mTOR-Rictor complexes (ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 Thr(389) and Akt Ser(473), respectively). By contrast, there was no direct inhibition of Akt Thr(308) phosphorylation, which is dependent on PI3K. Similar effects were also observed in cells that lack DNA-PK. The proliferation of TSC1-/- fibroblasts was inhibited in the presence of 401, but TSC1+/+ cells were resistant. In contrast to rapamycin, long-term treatment of TSC1-/- cells with 401 did not up-regulate phospho-Akt Ser(473). Because increased Akt activity promotes survival, this may explain why the level of apoptosis was increased in the presence of 401 but not rapamycin. These results suggest that mTOR kinase inhibitors might be more effective than rapamycins in controlling the growth of TSC hamartomas and other tumors that depend on elevated mTOR activity.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates multiple signals and regulates crucial cell functions via the molecular complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. These complexes are functionally dependent on their raptor (mTORC1) or rictor (mTORC2) subunits. mTOR has been associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway, but the functional contributions of individual complexes are largely unknown. We show, by oligodendrocyte-specific genetic deletion of Rptor and/or Rictor in the mouse, that CNS myelination is mainly dependent on mTORC1 function, with minor mTORC2 contributions. Myelin-associated lipogenesis and protein gene regulation are strongly reliant on mTORC1. We found that also oligodendrocyte-specific overactivation of mTORC1, via ablation of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), causes hypomyelination characterized by downregulation of Akt signaling and lipogenic pathways. Our data demonstrate that a delicately balanced regulation of mTORC1 activation and action in oligodendrocytes is essential for CNS myelination, which has practical overtones for understanding CNS myelin disorders.",

    "issue": "55(3)",
    "pages": "352-67",
    "abstract": "Constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 is associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and sustained growth of pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We investigated whether selective mTORC1 activation in SMCs induced by deleting the negative mTORC1 regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 1 gene (TSC1) was sufficient to produce PH in mice. Mice expressing Cre recombinase under SM22 promoter control were crossed with TSC1(LoxP/LoxP) mice to generate SM22-TSC1(-/-) mice. At 8 weeks of age, SM22-TSC1(-/-) mice exhibited PH with marked increases in distal PA muscularization and Ki67-positive PASMC counts, without systemic hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. Marked activation of the mTORC1 substrates S6 kinase and 4E-BP and the mTORC2 substrates p-Akt(Ser473) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 was found in the lungs and pulmonary vessels of SM22-TSC1(-/-) mice when compared with control mice. Treatment with 5 mg/kg rapamycin for 3 weeks to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 fully reversed PH in SM22-TSC1(-/-) mice. In chronically hypoxic mice and SM22-5HTT(+) mice exhibiting PH associated with mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, PH was maximally attenuated by low-dose rapamycin associated with selective mTORC1 inhibition. Cultured PASMCs from SM22-TSC1(-/-), SM22-5HTT(+), and chronically hypoxic mice exhibited similar sustained growth-rate enhancement and constitutive mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation; both effects were abolished by rapamycin. Deletion of the downstream mTORC1 effectors S6 kinase 1/2 in mice also activated mTOR signaling and induced PH. We concluded that activation of mTORC1 signaling leads to increased PASMC proliferation and subsequent PH development.",

    "issue": "18(1)",
    "pages": "151-63",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome in which severe renal cystic disease can occur. Many renal cystic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), are associated with absence or dysfunction of the primary cilium. We report here that hamartin (TSC1) localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium, and that Tsc1(-/-) and Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are significantly more likely to contain a primary cilium than wild-type controls. In addition, the cilia of Tsc1(-/-) and Tsc2(-/-) MEFs are 17-27% longer than cilia from wild-type MEFs. These data suggest a novel type of ciliary disruption in TSC, associated with enhanced cilia development. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins function as a heterodimer to inhibit the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). The enhanced ciliary formation in the Tsc1(-/-) and Tsc2(-/-) MEFs was not abrogated by rapamycin, which indicates a TORC1-independent mechanism. Polycystin 1 (PC1), the product of the PKD1 gene, has been found to interact with TSC2, but Pkd1(-/-) MEFs did not have enhanced ciliary formation. Furthermore, while activation of mTOR has been observed in renal cysts from ADPKD patients, Pkd1(-/-) MEFs did not have evidence of constitutive mTOR activation, thereby underscoring the independent functions of the TSC proteins and PC1 in regulation of primary cilia and mTOR. Our data link the TSC proteins with the primary cilium and reveal a novel phenotype of enhanced ciliary formation in a cyst-associated disease.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), composed of TSC1/TSC2 heterodimers, is inhibitory to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Deletion of either TSC1 or TSC2 renders mTOR constitutively active. To directly explore the impact of mTOR activation on B-cell development, we conditionally deleted TSC1 in murine B cells. This led to impairment in B-cell maturation. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to Akt activation, marginal zone (MZ) B cells were significantly reduced. Administration of rapamycin partially corrected the MZ defect, indicating a direct role for mTOR in controlling MZ development. When challenged with a T-cell-dependent antigen, TSC1 KO mice responded less efficiently. Consistent with the MZ defects, TSC1 KO mice did not respond at all to T-independent antigens. Because activation of Akt upstream of TSC and mTOR yields the reverse phenotype with respect to MZ development, we conclude that, physiologically, Akt simultaneously emits two opposing signals that counterbalance each other in the control of B-cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutants of Ras and Rho family small GTPases have proven to be important tools in analyzing signaling downstream of these small GTPases. The Ras-related GTPase Rheb has emerged as a key player downstream of TSC1-2 in activating signaling to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effectors of cell growth such as S6K and 4E-BP1. The TSC1-2 tumor suppressor complex has been shown to act as a RhebGAP, converting Rheb from a GTP-bound to a GDP-bound form. Here we report the identification of a mutant Rheb (S16HRheb) that exhibits gain-of-function properties. At endogenous levels of expression S16HRheb exhibits increased GTP loading in vivo and is resistant to TSC1-2 GAP in vitro. Compared with wild-type Rheb, S16HRheb is more active at promoting the phosphorylation of the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Thus S16HRheb will help to identify proximal signaling events downstream of Rheb and allow potential Rheb-independent functions downstream of TSC1-2 to be investigated.",

We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs.",

    "issue": "17(13)",

    "abstract": "More than 50% of transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder show loss of heterozygosity of a region spanning the TSC1 locus at 9q34 and mutations of TSC1 have been identified in 14.5% of tumours. These comprise nonsense mutations, splicing mutations, small deletions and missense mutations. Missense mutations are only rarely found in the germline in TSC disease. Therefore, we have examined six somatic missense mutations found in bladder cancer to determine whether these result in loss of function. We describe loss of function via distinct mechanisms. Five mutations caused mutually exclusive defects at mRNA and protein levels. Of these, two mutations caused pre-mRNA splicing errors that were predicted to result in premature protein truncation and three resulted in markedly reduced stability of exogenous TSC1 protein. Primary tumours with aberrant TSC1 pre-mRNA splicing were confirmed as negative for TSC1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Expression was also significantly reduced in a tumour with a TSC1 missense mutation resulting in diminished protein half-life. A single TSC1 missense mutation identified in a tumour with retained heterozygosity of the TSC1 region on chromosome 9 caused an apparently TSC2- and mTOR-independent localization defect of the mutant protein. We conclude that although TSC1 missense mutations do not play a major role in causation of TSC disease, they represent a significant proportion of somatic loss of function mutations in bladder cancer.",

To study the regulation of mTORC2 activity, it is a common practice to examine the phosphorylation of its substrates in vivo and verify the findings with an in vitro assay of kinase activity.

    "pages": "2632-40",
    "abstract": "Barrett's esophagus, a columnar metaplasia of the lower esophagus epithelium related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, is the strongest known risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Understanding the signal transduction events involved in esophageal epithelium carcinogenesis may provide insights into the origins of EAC and may suggest new therapies. To elucidate the molecular pathways of bile acid-induced tumorigenesis, the newly identified inflammation-associated signaling pathway involving I kappaB kinases beta (IKK beta), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream effector S6 kinase (S6K1) was confirmed to be activated in immortalized Barrett's CPC-A and CPC-C cells and esophageal cancer SEG-1 and BE3 cells. Phosphorylation of TSC1 and S6K1 was induced in response to bile acid stimulation. Treatment of these cells with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the IKK beta inhibitor Bay 11-7082 suppressed bile acid-induced cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. We next used an orthotopic rat model to evaluate the role of bile acid in the progression of Barrett's esophagus to EAC. Of interest, we found high expression of phosphorylated IKK beta (pIKK beta) and phosphorylated S6K1 (pS6K1) in tumor tissues and the Barrett's epithelium compared with normal epithelium. Furthermore, immunostaining of clinical EAC tissue specimens revealed that pIKK beta expression was strongly correlated with pS6K1 level. Together, these results show that bile acid can deregulate TSC1/mTOR through IKK beta signaling, which may play a critical role in EAC progression. In addition, Bay 11-7082 and rapamycin may potentially be chemopreventive drugs against Barrett's esophagus-associated EAC.",

    "issue": "11(1)",
    "pages": "129",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a monogenic disease resulting from defects of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode the proteins forming hamartin-tuberin tumor suppressor complex, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTOR). The mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in response to tuberin or hamartin defects. The mTOR pathway is also regulated by a multitude of epigenetic mechanisms, one of which is regulation by microRNA (miRNA) inhibition. This leads us to hypothesize that organ-level abnormalities of miRNA expression patterns are widespread in TSC. The aim of the study was to evaluate the serum profiles of miRNAs in patients with TSC and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) treated with mTOR inhibitor (everolimus).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSerum microRNA profiling was performed in 10 TSC-patients before and three months after everolimus treatment, as well as in 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. MicroRNAs were profiled using qPCR panels (Exiqon).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 752 tested miRNAs, 11 showed statistically significant dysregulation in patients with TSC in comparison to controls. The following miRNAs were downregulated in TSC: miR-142-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-142-5p and miR-136-5p; while miR-130a-3p, miR-378a-3p, miR-130b-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-25-3p, miR-215-5p and miR-222-3p were upregulated in TSC in comparison to the control group. After three months of everolimus treatment, mean dose 5.1 (2.6-9.7) mg/m2, seven miRNAs reached expression levels similar to healthy controls, with miR-142-3p and miR-136 showed significant increase over baseline levels in TSC patients. Moreover, miR-222-3p normalization due to treatment differed between patients with mutation in TSC1 and TSC2 gene.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nActivation of the mTOR pathway in TSC patients alters serum miRNA levels, which may be partially reversed by an mTOR inhibitor. This indicates the involvement of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of TSC, linking miRNA profiles with treatment efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human Tsc1 and Tsc2 genes predispose to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a disorder characterized by the wide spread of benign tumors. Tsc1 and Tsc2 proteins form a complex and serve as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb, a GTPase regulating a downstream kinase, mTOR. The genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains tsc1(+) and tsc2(+), homologs of human Tsc1 and Tsc2, respectively. In this study we analyzed the gene expression profile on a genomewide scale and found that deletion of either tsc1(+) or tsc2(+) affects gene induction upon nitrogen starvation. Three hours after nitrogen depletion genes encoding permeases and genes required for meiosis are less induced. Under the same condition, retrotransposons, G1-cyclin (pas1(+)), and inv1(+) are more induced. We also demonstrate that a mutation (cpp1-1) in a gene encoding a beta-subunit of a farnesyltransferase can suppress most of the phenotypes associated with deletion of tsc1(+) or tsc2(+). When a mutant of rhb1(+) (homolog of human Rheb), which bypasses the requirement of protein farnesylation, was expressed, the cpp1-1 mutation could no longer suppress, indicating that deficient farnesylation of Rhb1 contributes to the suppression. On the basis of these results, we discuss TSC pathology and possible improvement in chemotherapy for TSC.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a cystic lung disease that can be included in the wide group of proliferative lesions named PEComas (perivascular epithelioid cell tumors). These proliferative tumors are characterized by the coexpression of myogenic and melanogenesis-related markers. In all these lesions, genetic alterations related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have been demonstrated. Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway. These data have opened a new era in the comprehension of the pathogenesis of LAM and have also suggested new therapeutic strategies for this potentially lethal disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo present and discuss the pathologic and molecular features of LAM within the spectrum of PEComas, providing a rational approach to their diagnosis.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nThe published literature and personal experience.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe inclusion of LAM within the PEComa category is supported by a variety of biologic data and can significantly help in providing a comprehensive view of this interesting and clinically relevant group of lesions. The demonstration of molecular alterations of the mTOR pathway in LAM and other PEComas represents a rational basis for innovative therapeutic approaches with inhibitors of mTOR signaling.",

    "issue": "7(10)",
    "pages": "1173-86",
    "abstract": "It has been well documented that cells deficient in either TSC1 or TSC2 are highly sensitive to various cell death stimuli. In this study, we utilized the TSC2 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to study the involvement of autophagy in the enhanced susceptibility of TSC2-null cells to cell death. We first confirmed that both TSC1-null and TSC2-null MEFs are more sensitive to apoptosis in response to amino acid starvation (EBSS) and hypoxia. Second, we found that both the basal and inducible autophagy in TSC2 (-/-) MEFs is impaired, mainly due to constitutive activation of mTORC1. Third, suppression of autophagy by chloroquine and Atg7 knockdown sensitizes TSC2 (+/+) cells, but not TSC2 (-/-) cells, to EBSS-induced cell death. Conversely, the inhibition of mTORC1 by raptor knockdown and rapamycin activates autophagy and subsequently rescues TSC2 (-/-) cells. Finally, in starved cells, nutrient supplementations (insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and leucine) enhanced cell death in TSC2 (-/-) cells, but reduced cell death in TSC2 (+/+) cells. Taken together, these data indicate that constitutive activation of mTORC1 in TSC2 (-/-) cells leads to suppression of autophagy and enhanced susceptibility to stress-mediated cell death. Our findings thus provide new insights into the complex relationships among mTOR, autophagy and cell death, and support the possible autophagy-targeted intervention strategies for the treatment of TSC-related pathologies.",

    "issue": "64(2)",
    "pages": "519-28",
    "abstract": "Interconversion of white and brown adipocytes occurs between anabolic and catabolic states. The molecular mechanism regulating this phenotypic switch remains largely unknown. This study explores the role of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1)-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the conversion of brown to white adipose tissue (WAT). A colony of Fabp4-Tsc1(-/-) mice, in which the Tsc1 gene was specifically deleted by the fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4)-Cre, was established. Western blotting and immunostaining demonstrated the absence of TSC1 and activation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, the downstream target of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, in the brown adipose tissues (BATs) of Fabp4-Tsc1(-/-) mice. Accumulation of lipid droplets in BAT was significantly increased. Levels of brown adipocyte markers were markedly downregulated, while white adipocyte markers were upregulated. Rapamycin reversed the conversion from BAT to WAT in Fabp4-Tsc1(-/-) mice. Deletion of the Tsc1 gene in cultured brown preadipocytes significantly increased the conversion to white adipocytes. FoxC2 mRNA, the transcriptional factor for brown adipocyte determination, was significantly decreased, while mRNAs for retinoblastoma protein, p107 and RIP140, the transcriptional factors for white adipocyte determination, increased in the BAT of Fabp4-Tsc1(-/-) mice. Our study demonstrates that TSC1-mTORC1 signaling contributes to the brown-to-white adipocyte phenotypic switch.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulate angiogenesis and cell growth in the developing brain. EGF, HGF, and VEGF modulate the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, a pathway regulating cell growth that is aberrantly activated in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We hypothesized that expression of EGF, HGF, VEGF, and their receptors EGFR, c-Met, and Flt-1, respectively, would be altered in TSC. We show by cDNA array and immunohistochemical analysis that EGF, EGFR, HGF, c-Met, and VEGF, but not Flt-1, mRNA, and protein expression was up-regulated in Tsc1 conditional knockout (Tsc1(GFAP)CKO) mouse cortex. Importantly, these alterations closely predicted enhanced expression of these proteins in tuber and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) specimens in TSC. Expression of EGF, EGFR, HGF, c-Met, and VEGF protein, as well as hypoxia inducible factor-1α, a transcription factor that regulates VEGF levels and is also modulated by mTOR cascade activity, was enhanced in SEGAs (n = 6) and tubers (n = 10) from 15 TSC patients. Enhanced expression of these growth factors and growth factor receptors in human SEGAs and tubers and in the Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mouse may account for enhanced cellular growth and proliferation in tubers and SEGAs and provides potential target molecules for therapeutic development in TSC.",

    "abstract": "TBC7, a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) 1 domain protein, was identified as a novel binding protein to the TSC1-TSC2 tumor suppressor complex by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of the proteins immunoprecipitated with FLAG-epitope tagged TSC1 and TSC2 from the transfected mammalian cells. The in vivo and in vitro association of TBC7 and the TSC1-TSC2 complex was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down analysis, respectively, and TBC7 was revealed to bind to the C-terminal half region of TSC1, which is distinct from the binding site with TSC2. The immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation showed that TBC7 co-localizes with the tumor suppressor complex in the endomembrane. Overexpression of TBC7 enhanced ubiquitination of TSC1 and increased phosphorylation of S6 protein by S6 kinase, that is located in the mTOR-signaling pathway. These results indicate TBC7 could take a part in the negative regulation of the tumor suppressor complex through facilitating the downregulation of TSC1.",

    "abstract": "Muscle mass is regulated by a wide range of hormonal and nutritional signals, such as insulin and IGF. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited hamartoma disease with tumor growth in numerous organs. TSC is caused by mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes that negatively regulate insulin-induced S6K activation and cell growth. Here we report that expression of human TSC1 (hTSC1) in mouse skeletal muscle leads to reduction of muscle mass. Expression of hTSC1 stabilizes endogenous TSC2 and leads to inhibition of the mTOR signaling. The hTSC1-mTSC2 hetero-complex and its downstream components remain sensitive to insulin stimulation and nutrition signals. This study suggests that an increase in the steady state level of resident TSC1-TSC2 complex is sufficient to reduce muscle mass and cause atrophy.",

    "issue": "25(49)",
    "pages": "6467-79",
    "abstract": "TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin, are tumor suppressor genes responsible for the autosomal dominantly inherited disease tuberous sclerosis (TSC). TSC affects approximately 1 in 6000 individuals and is characterized by the development of tumors, named hamartomas, in different organs. Hamartin and tuberin form a complex, of which tuberin is assumed to be the functional component. The TSC proteins have been implicated in the control of cell cycle and cell size. In addition to enhanced growth, reduced death rates can lead to tumor development. Therefore, defects in the apoptosis-inducing pathways contribute to neoplastic cell expansion. Here, we show that tuberin triggers apoptosis, accompanied by downregulation of p70S6K activity and of phosphorylation of BAD on residue Ser136, and by upregulation of the interaction of BAD/BCL-2 and BAD/BCL-XL. AKT phosphorylation negatively regulates tuberin's potential to trigger apoptosis. Experiments with BAD-/- cells demonstrate BAD to be a mediator of tuberin's effects on the regulation of apoptosis. Tuberin interferes with insulin-like growth factor-1-induced BAD Ser136 phosphorylation and cell survival. Our work proposes a model in which tuberin-mediated inhibition of p70S6K activates BAD to heterodimerize with BCL-2 and BCL-XL to promote apoptosis. A mutation of TSC2--as it occurs in TSC patients--attenuates this proapoptotic potential, underscoring the relevance of our findings for human pathophysiology.",

We recently found that the TSC1-TSC2 complex promotes the activity of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), an upstream activator of Akt, and this occurs independent of its inhibitory effects on mTORC1. Loss of mTORC2 activity in cells lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex, coupled with mTORC1-mediated feedback mechanisms, leads to strong attenuation of the growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on S473. In this study, we show that both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent mTORC2 substrates are affected by loss of the TSC1-TSC2 complex in cell culture models and kidney tumors from both Tsc2(+/-) mice (adenoma) and TSC patients (angiomyolipoma). These mTORC2 targets are all members of the AGC kinase family and include Akt, protein kinase Calpha, and serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1. We also show that the TSC1-TSC2 complex can directly stimulate the in vitro kinase activity of mTORC2. The interaction between these two complexes is mediated primarily through regions on TSC2 and a core component of mTORC2 called Rictor. Hence, loss of the TSC tumor suppressors results in elevated mTORC1 signaling and attenuated mTORC2 signaling. These findings suggest that the TSC1-TSC2 complex plays opposing roles in tumor progression, both blocking and promoting specific oncogenic pathways through its effects on mTORC1 inhibition and mTORC2 activation, respectively.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe management of slow or non-healing ulcerations constitutes an increasing clinical challenge in the developed world because of the ageing of the population and the pandemic rise in type II diabetes. Recent studies suggest that molecular circuitries deployed by tumor cells to promote cancerous growth may also contribute to tissue regeneration. Here, we exploited this emerging information to search for novel molecular targets to accelerate wound healing.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nWe found that the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, whose aberrant function is a frequent event in human neoplasia, represents an integral component of the normal wound healing process. By the use of genetically defined approaches, including the epithelial-specific ablation of Pten and Tsc1, we show that mTOR activation can dramatically increase epithelial cell proliferation, migration, and cutaneous wound healing, while pharmacological inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin delays wound closure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nOverall, our findings indicate that the transient pharmacologic activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis may represent a novel clinical intervention strategy to accelerate the healing of debilitating and life-threatening wounds.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC tumorigenesis is not always accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) has been found activated in TSC lesions lacking TSC1 or TSC2 LOH. Here, we show that Erk may play a critical role in TSC progression through posttranslational inactivation of TSC2. Erk-dependent phosphorylation leads to TSC1-TSC2 dissociation and markedly impairs TSC2 ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. Importantly, expression of an Erk nonphosphorylatable TSC2 mutant in TSC2+/- tumor cells where Erk is constitutively activated blocks tumorigenecity in vivo, while wild-type TSC2 is ineffective. Our findings position the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream of the TSC complex and suggest that Erk may modulate mTOR signaling and contribute to disease progression through phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in either the tsc1 or tsc2 tumor suppressor gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that TSC2 displays GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity specifically towards the small G protein Rheb and inhibits its ability to stimulate the mTOR signaling pathway. Rheb and TSC2 comprise a unique pair of GTPase and GAP, because Rheb has high basal GTP levels and TSC2 does not have the catalytic arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. To investigate the function of TSC2 and Rheb in mTOR signaling, we analyzed the TSC2-stimulated Rheb GTPase activity. We found that Arg15, a residue equivalent to Gly12 in Ras, is important for Rheb to function as a substrate for TSC2 GAP. In addition, we identified asparagine residues essential for TSC2 GAP activity. We demonstrated a novel catalytic mechanism of the TSC2 GAP and Rheb that TSC2 uses a catalytic \"asparagine thumb\" instead of the arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. Furthermore, we discovered that farnesylation and membrane localization of Rheb is not essential for Rheb to stimulate S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Analysis of TSC1 binding defective mutants of TSC2 shows that TSC1 is not required for the TSC2 GAP activity but may function as a regulatory component in the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Our data further demonstrate that GAP activity is essential for the cellular function of TSC2 to inhibit S6K phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced activity of interleukin 17 (IL-17) producing T helper 17 (Th17) cells plays an important role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Significant loss of body weight and appetite is associated with chronic inflammation and immune activation, suggesting the cross talk between immune and neuroendocrine systems. Ghrelin has been shown to regulate the organism immune function. However, the effects of ghrelin on the differentiation of Th17 cells remain elusive. In the present study, we observed the enhanced differentiation of Th17 cells in spleens of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a)-/- mice. Treatment of ghrelin repressed Th17 cell differentiation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was increased in the spleens of GHSR1a-/- mice. Activation of mTOR signaling by injection of Cre-expressiong adenovirus into tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) loxp/loxp mice increased the differentiation of Th17 cells in spleen, which was associated with an increment in the phosphorylation of STAT3. Activation of mTOR signaling by leucine or overexpression of p70 ribosome protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activated mTOR signaling in isolated T cells, while reversed the ghrelin-induced inhibition of iTh17 cell differentiation. In conclusion, mTOR mediates the inhibitory effect of ghrelin on the differentiation of Th17 cells by interacting with STAT3.",

    "title": "Deletion of tuberous sclerosis 1 in somatic cells of the murine reproductive tract causes female infertility.",
    "issue": "153(1)",
    "pages": "404-16",
    "abstract": "Tumors develop with dysregulated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the kinase activity of which is kept in an inactive state by a tumor suppressor dimer containing tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and TSC2. We examined whether conditional deletion of TSC1 by a knock-in allele of the anti-Müllerian hormone type 2 receptor (Amhr2) driving Cre expression and subsequent activation of mTOR in granulosa cells and in oviductal and uterine stromal cells affects fertility in female mice. Increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of activated mTOR, was observed in all AMHR2-expressing tissues examined, indicating loss of TSC1 activity. TSC1 deletion in granulosa cells led to the detection of significantly fewer primordial follicles in mutant mice at 12 wk, suggesting premature ovarian insufficiency, which might be related to the significantly increased time mutant mice spent in estrus. Although the number of good-quality ovulated oocytes was not significantly different compared with controls, there was a significantly higher number of degenerated oocytes after normal and superovulation, suggesting compromised oocyte quality, as well. Natural mating also showed severalfold higher numbers of degenerate bodies in the mutants that collected in bilateral swellings resembling hydrosalpinges that formed in all mice examined because of occlusion of the proximal oviduct. Attempts to transfer control embryos into mutant uteri also failed, indicating that implantation was compromised. Endometrial epithelial cells continued to proliferate, and quantitative RT-PCR showed that mucin 1 expression persisted during the window of implantation in mutant uteri, without any changes in progesterone receptor mRNA expression, suggesting a mechanism that does not involve disrupted estradiol-regulated progesterone receptor expression. Homozygous deletion of TSC1 in reproductive tract somatic tissues of mice rendered females completely infertile, which is likely due to these pleiotropic effects on follicle recruitment, oviductal development, and blastocyst implantation.",

    "issue": "66(16)",
    "pages": "7934-8",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Both genes are generally considered to act as tumor suppressors that fulfill Knudson's \"two-hit hypothesis\" and that function within the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We previously generated Tsc1(+/-) mice that are predisposed to renal cysts, which develop into cystadenomas and renal cell carcinomas. Here, we identified somatic Tsc1 mutations (second hits) in approximately 80% of cystadenomas and renal cell carcinomas, but only 31.6% of cysts from Tsc1(+/-) mice (P < 0.0003), raising the possibility that haploinsufficiency for Tsc1 plays a role in cyst formation. Consistent with this proposal, many cysts showed little or no staining for phosphorylated mTOR (53%) and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (37%), whereas >90% of cystadenomas and renal cell carcinomas showed strong staining for both markers (P < 0.0005). We also sought somatic mutations in renal lesions from Tsc1(+/-) Blm(-/-) mice that have a high frequency of somatic loss of heterozygosity, thereby facilitating the detection of second hits. We also found significantly less somatic mutations in cysts as compared with cystadenomas and renal cell carcinomas from these mice (P = 0.017). Our data indicate that although activation of the mTOR pathway is an important step in Tsc-associated renal tumorigenesis, it may not be the key initiating event in this process.",

    "title": "Therapeutic Strategy for Targeting Aggressive Malignant Gliomas by Disrupting Their Energy Balance.",
    "issue": "291(41)",
    "pages": "21496-21509",
    "abstract": "Although abnormal metabolic regulation is a critical determinant of cancer cell behavior, it is still unclear how an altered balance between ATP production and consumption contributes to malignancy. Here we show that disruption of this energy balance efficiently suppresses aggressive malignant gliomas driven by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivation. In a mouse glioma model, mTORC1 hyperactivation induced by conditional Tsc1 deletion increased numbers of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) in vitro and in vivo Metabolic analysis revealed that mTORC1 hyperactivation enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by elevations in oxygen consumption rate and ATP production. Inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthetase was more effective in repressing sphere formation by Tsc1-deficient glioma cells than that by Tsc1-competent glioma cells, indicating a crucial function for mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity in GIC expansion. To translate this observation into the development of novel therapeutics targeting malignant gliomas, we screened drug libraries for small molecule compounds showing greater efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation/survival of Tsc1-deficient cells compared with controls. We identified several compounds able to preferentially inhibit mitochondrial activity, dramatically reducing ATP levels and blocking glioma sphere formation. In human patient-derived glioma cells, nigericin, which reportedly suppresses cancer stem cell properties, induced AMPK phosphorylation that was associated with mTORC1 inactivation and induction of autophagy and led to a marked decrease in sphere formation with loss of GIC marker expression. Furthermore, malignant characteristics of human glioma cells were markedly suppressed by nigericin treatment in vivo Thus, targeting mTORC1-driven processes, particularly those involved in maintaining a cancer cell's energy balance, may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glioma patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multiorgan genetic disease in which brain involvement causes epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. The hallmark pathological finding in TSC is the cerebral cortical tuber and its unique constituent, giant cells. However, an animal model that replicates giant cells has not yet been described. Here, we report that mosaic induction of Tsc1 loss in neural progenitor cells in Tsc1(cc) Nestin-rtTA(+) TetOp-cre(+) embryos by doxycycline leads to multiple neurological symptoms, including severe epilepsy and premature death. Strikingly, Tsc1-null neural progenitor cells develop into highly enlarged giant cells with enlarged vacuoles. We found that the vacuolated giant cells had multiple signs of organelle dysfunction, including markedly increased mitochondria, aberrant lysosomes, and elevated cellular stress. We found similar vacuolated giant cells in human tuber specimens. Postnatal rapamycin treatment completely reversed these phenotypes and rescued the mutants from epilepsy and premature death, despite prenatal onset of Tsc1 loss and mTOR complex 1 activation in the developing brain. This TSC brain model provides insights into the pathogenesis and organelle dysfunction of giant cells, as well as epilepsy control in patients with TSC.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized by hamartomatous neurological lesions that exhibit abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation. Hyperactivation of mTOR pathway by mutations in either the Tsc1 or Tsc2 gene underlies TSC pathogenesis, but involvement of specific neural cell populations in the formation of TSC-associated neurological lesions remains unclear. We deleted Tsc1 in Emx1-expressing embryonic telencephalic neural stem cells (NSCs) and found that mutant mice faithfully recapitulated TSC neuropathological lesions, such as cortical lamination defects and subependymal nodules (SENs). These alterations were caused by enhanced generation of SVZ neural progeny, followed by their premature differentiation and impaired maturation during both embryonic and postnatal development. Notably, mTORC1-dependent Akt inhibition and STAT3 activation were involved in the reduced self-renewal and earlier neuronal and astroglial differentiation of mutant NSCs. Thus, finely tuned mTOR activation in embryonic NSCs may be critical to prevent development of TSC-associated brain lesions.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits are regulated by activity-dependent feedback systems that tightly control network excitability and which are thought to be crucial for proper brain development. Defects in the ability to establish and maintain network homeostasis may be central to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine the function of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mTOR signaling pathway, a common target of mutations associated with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, in regulating activity-dependent processes in the mouse hippocampus. We find that the TSC-mTOR pathway is a central component of a positive feedback loop that promotes network activity by repressing inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons. In Tsc1 KO neurons, weakened inhibition caused by deregulated mTOR alters the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, leading to hippocampal hyperexcitability. These findings identify the TSC-mTOR pathway as a regulator of neural network activity and have implications for the neurological dysfunction in disorders exhibiting deregulated mTOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "In their study published in Science Signaling (Research Article, 27 March 2012, DOI: 10.1126/scisignal.2002469), Dalle Pezze et al. tackle the dynamic and complex wiring of the signaling network involving the protein kinase mTOR, which exists within two distinct protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that differ in their regulation and function. The authors use a combination of immunoblotting for specific phosphorylation events and computational modeling. The primary experimental tool employed is to monitor the autophosphorylation of mTOR on Ser(2481) in cell lysates as a surrogate for mTOR activity, which the authors conclude is a specific readout for mTORC2. However, Ser(2481) phosphorylation occurs on both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and will dynamically change as the network through which these two complexes are connected is manipulated. Therefore, models of mTOR network regulation built using this tool are inherently imperfect and open to alternative explanations. Specific issues with the main conclusion made in this study, involving the TSC1-TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2) complex and its potential regulation of mTORC2, are discussed here. A broader goal of this Letter is to clarify to other investigators the caveats of using mTOR Ser(2481) phosphorylation in cell lysates as a specific readout for either of the two mTOR complexes.",

    "abstract": "The mTOR/S6K/4E-BP1 pathway integrates extracellular signals derived from growth factors, and intracellular signals, determined by the availability of nutrients like amino acids and glucose. Activation of this pathway requires inhibition of the tumor suppressor complex TSC1/2. TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein for the small GTPase Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), GTP loading of which activates mTOR by a yet unidentified mechanism. The level at which this pathway senses the availability of amino acids is unknown but is suggested to be at the level of TSC2. Here, we show that amino-acid depletion completely blocks insulin- and TPA-induced Rheb activation. This indicates that amino-acid sensing occurs upstream of Rheb. Despite this, amino-acid depletion can still inhibit mTOR/S6 kinase signaling in TSC2-/- fibroblasts. Since under these conditions Rheb-GTP levels remain high, a second level of amino-acid sensing exists, affecting mTOR activity in a Rheb-independent fashion.",

    "issue": "37(31)",
    "pages": "7534-7546",
    "abstract": "Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an essential regulator of developmental oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a major upstream inhibitor of mTOR, surprisingly also leads to hypomyelination during CNS development. However, the function of TSC has not been studied in the context of remyelination. Here, we used the inducible Cre-lox system to study the function of TSC in the remyelination of a focal, lysolecithin-demyelinated lesion in adult male mice. Using two different mouse models in which Tsc1 is deleted by Cre expression in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or in premyelinating oligodendrocytes, we reveal that deletion of Tsc1 affects oligodendroglia differently depending on the stage of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Tsc1 deletion from NG2+ OPCs accelerated remyelination. Conversely, Tsc1 deletion from proteolipid protein (PLP)-positive oligodendrocytes slowed remyelination. Contrary to developmental myelination, there were no changes in OPC or oligodendrocyte numbers in either model. Our findings reveal a complex role for TSC in oligodendrocytes during remyelination in which the timing of Tsc1 deletion is a critical determinant of its effect on remyelination. Moreover, our findings suggest that TSC has different functions in developmental myelination and remyelination.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Myelin loss in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis results in disability due to loss of axon conductance and axon damage. Encouragingly, the nervous system is capable of spontaneous remyelination, but this regenerative process often fails. Many chronically demyelinated lesions have oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) within their borders. It is thus of great interest to elucidate mechanisms by which we might enhance endogenous remyelination. Here, we provide evidence that deletion of Tsc1 from OPCs, but not differentiating oligodendrocytes, is beneficial to remyelination. This finding contrasts with the loss of oligodendroglia and hypomyelination seen with Tsc1 or Tsc2 deletion in the oligodendrocyte lineage during CNS development and points to important differences in the regulation of developmental myelination and remyelination.",

    "pages": "563-570",
    "abstract": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS), which is primarily mediated by the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/Akt kinase signalling cassette, is a highly evolutionarily conserved pathway involved in co-ordinating growth, development, ageing and nutrient homeostasis with dietary intake. It controls transcriptional regulators, in addition to promoting signalling by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), which stimulates biosynthesis of proteins and other macromolecules, and drives organismal growth. Previous studies in nutrient-storing germline nurse cells of the Drosophila ovary showed that a cytoplasmic pool of activated phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) controlled by Pten, an antagonist of IIS, cell-autonomously regulates accumulation of large lipid droplets in these cells at late stages of oogenesis. Here, we show that the large lipid droplet phenotype induced by Pten mutation is strongly suppressed when mTor function is removed. Furthermore, nurse cells lacking either Tsc1 or Tsc2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activity, also accumulate large lipid droplets via a mechanism involving Rheb, the downstream G-protein target of TSC2, which positively regulates mTORC1. We conclude that elevated IIS/mTORC1 signalling is both necessary and sufficient to induce large lipid droplet formation in late-stage nurse cells, suggesting roles for this pathway in aspects of lipid droplet biogenesis, in addition to control of lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), the primary biologically active compound isolated from the root bark of P. kaempferi Gordon, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor effect primarily via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our previous study demonstrated that PAB triggered mitotic catastrophe in L929 cells. In addition, a small percentage of the cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe displayed an apoptotic phenotype. Therefore, we continued to investigate the fate of the other cells. The results indicated that PAB induced senescence through p19-p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways in L929 cells. PAB also triggered autophagy via inhibiting Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in L929 cells. In addition, autophagy was demonstrated to reinforce senescence through regulating the senescence pathways. Thus, we focused on the detailed molecular mechanisms whereby autophagy promoted senescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important in autophagy and senescence. We found that PAB triggered a ROS-JNK-p53 positive feedback loop and this feedback loop played a crucial role in autophagy via repressing the activation of mTOR. Furthermore, ROS-JNK-p53 positive feedback loop was demonstrated to regulate senescence. Tuberous sclerosis proteins1 and 2, also known as TSC1 and TSC2, form a protein-complex. TSC1/TSC2 heterodimer is a downstream target of growth factor-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling which negatively regulates mTOR activity. Activation of mTOR by insulin or inhibition of endogenous TSC2 levels by siRNA obviously delayed PAB-induced senescence. In conclusion, mTOR inactivation by ROS-JNK-p53 pathway played an important role in autophagy-dependent senescence in PAB-treated L929 cells.",

    "issue": "214(3)",
    "pages": "387-93",
    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (PEComas) are a family of tumours including classic angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and clear epithelioid cell tumours reported under a variety of names such as epithelioid angiomyolipoma, pulmonary and extrapulmonary clear cell sugar tumour, and PEComa. Our previous comparative genomic hybridization study of PEComas demonstrated recurrent chromosomal aberrations including deletions on chromosome 16p, where the TSC2 gene is located. In this study, we focused on the alteration of chromosome 16p, including TSC2. We collected ten sporadic and two tuberous sclerosis complex-associated PEComas, as well as 14 sporadic classic hepatic and renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) as controls. We used 16 microsatellite markers distributed along chromosome 16p to test for allelic imbalances on chromosome 16p and at TSC2, and two markers for TSC1. Furthermore, we carried out immunohistochemical staining for phospho-p706K, phospho-AKT, and phospho-S6 to evaluate the effect of TSC2 alterations on the mTOR signalling pathway. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 11 PEComas and involved the region of the TSC2 locus in seven. Six classic angiomyolipomas had allelic changes at chromosome 16p. Microsatellite instability was detected in two PEComas. The incidence of genetic aberrations was significantly higher in the PEComa group. Only one PEComa showed LOH at the TSC1 locus. Eleven PEComas and 13 AMLs revealed elevated phospho-p70S6K accompanied by reduced phospho-AKT. Five PEComas and eight classic angiomyolipomas were positive for phospho-S6. The phosphorylation profile indicates functional activation of the mTOR pathway through a disrupted TSC1/2 complex. Our observations of frequent deletion of TSC2 and the mTOR signalling pathway provide evidence that the oncogenetic lineage of PEComa, as a distinct TSC2-linked neoplasm, is similar to that of angiomyolipoma.",

    "pages": "ra24",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a nutrient-sensitive protein kinase that is aberrantly activated in many human cancers. Whether dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling in normal tissues increases the risk for cancer, however, is unknown. We focused on hepatocellular carcinoma, which has been linked to environmental factors that affect mTORC1 activity, including diet. Ablation of the gene encoding TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), which as part of the TSC1-TSC2 complex is an upstream inhibitor of mTORC1, results in constitutively increased mTORC1 signaling, an effect on this pathway similar to that of obesity. We found that mice with liver-specific knockout of Tsc1 developed sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma with heterogeneous histological and biochemical features. The spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma in this mouse model was preceded by a series of pathological changes that accompany the primary etiologies of this cancer in humans, including liver damage, inflammation, necrosis, and regeneration. Chronic mTORC1 signaling led to unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress and defects in autophagy, factors that contributed to hepatocyte damage and hepatocellular carcinoma development. Therefore, we conclude that increased activation of mTORC1 can promote carcinogenesis and may thus represent a key molecular link between cancer risk and environmental factors, such as diet.",

    "pages": "166-172",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation in localized brain overgrowth is evolving. We describe two patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) who demonstrated somatic mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes in the dysplastic brain tissue but not peripheral blood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPaired whole-exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from blood and excised brain tissue in two children with FCD who underwent excision of dysplastic tissue.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient 1, a 14-year boy, had drug-resistant focal epilepsy with onset at 20 months. His brain MRI showed abnormalities suggestive of FCD in the left superior and middle frontal lobes. Patient 2 presented at the age of 10 years with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy (onset at six years). His MRI suggested FCD in the left insular lobe. Both patients underwent surgical excision of FCD, and excised tissues were pathologically confirmed to have type IIb FCD. For patient 1, a missense mutation (c.64C > T; p.Arg22Trp) was detected in the TSC1 gene in DNA of dysplastic brain tissue but not peripheral blood lymphocytes. Similarly, for patient 2, a frameshift mutation (c.4258_4261delCAGT; p.Ser1420GlyfsTer55) in the TSC2 gene was identified in the brain tissue but not blood. Both gene variants are likely pathogenic and cause mTOR pathway activation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur report of TSC1/TSC2 somatic mutations in patients with non-syndromic FCD suggests that localized hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway can cause focal malformations during cortical development and presents pharmacological targets for precision therapy in FCD management.",

    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipomas (AML) contain an admixture of clonal tumour cells with features of several different mesenchymal lineages, implying the existence of an unidentified AML neoplastic stem cell. Biallelic inactivation of TSC2 or TSC1 is believed to represent the driving event in these tumours. Here we show that TSC2 knockdown transforms senescence-resistant cultured mouse and human renal epithelial cells into neoplastic stem cells that serially propagate renal AML-like tumours in mice. mTOR inhibitory therapy of mouse AML allografts mimics the clinical responses of human renal AMLs. Deletion of Tsc1 in mouse renal epithelia causes differentiation in vivo into cells expressing characteristic AML markers. Human renal AML and a renal AML cell line express proximal tubule markers. We describe the first mouse models of renal AML and provide evidence that these mesenchymal tumours originate from renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, uncovering an unexpected pathological differentiation plasticity of the proximal tubule.",

The objective of this study was to investigate how tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 or TSC2 deficiency alters MMP expression and regulation. We studied immortalized cells that lack TSC2 derived from an angiomyolipoma of a patient with LAM, a TSC2 addback derivative, and murine embryonic fibroblast cells that lack Tsc1 or -2 and respective controls. Global gene expression analysis was performed in the angiomyolipoma and derivative cell lines. MMP levels in the conditioned media from these cells were analyzed by zymography and ELISA. We found increased MMP-2 expression in cells lacking TSC1/TSC2 compared with their respective controls by zymography. MMP-2 overproduction by these cells was not affected by rapamycin treatment. Gene expression analysis confirmed increased MMP-2 gene expression that was not affected by rapamycin. Furthermore, multiple other genes were found to be overexpressed in rapamycin-treated TSC2-deficient cells compared with TSC2(+) cells. We conclude that TSC1/TSC2 deficiency leads to MMP-2 overproduction that is rapamycin-insensitive, and that several genes exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that TSC1/TSC2-dependent, but mammalian target of rapamycin-independent, pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of LAM.",

    "issue": "69(18)",
    "pages": "7224-34",
    "abstract": "During development, proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), candidate cells-of-origin for the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, requires signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the pathways of which are also implicated in medulloblastoma. One of the consequences of IGF signaling is inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-suppressing tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), comprised of TSC1 and TSC2, leading to increased mRNA translation. We show that mice, in which TSC function is impaired, display increased mTOR pathway activation, enhanced CGNP proliferation, glycogen synthase kinase-3 alpha/beta (GSK-3 alpha/beta) inactivation, and cytoplasmic localization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), which has been proposed to cause its inactivation or gain of oncogenic functions. We observed the same characteristics in wild-type primary cultures of CGNPs in which TSC1 and/or TSC2 were knocked down, and in mouse medulloblastomas induced by ectopic Shh pathway activation. Moreover, Shh-induced mouse medulloblastomas manifested Akt-mediated TSC2 inactivation, and the mutant TSC2 allele synergized with aberrant Shh signaling to increase medulloblastoma incidence in mice. Driving exogenous TSC2 expression in Shh-induced medulloblastoma cells corrected p27(Kip1) localization and reduced proliferation. GSK-3 alpha/beta inactivation in the tumors in vivo and in primary CGNP cultures was mTOR-dependent, whereas p27(Kip1) cytoplasmic localization was regulated upstream of mTOR by TSC2. These results indicate that a balance between Shh mitogenic signaling and TSC function regulating new protein synthesis and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition is essential for the normal development and prevention of tumor formation or expansion.",

    "issue": "82()",
    "pages": "22-31",
    "abstract": "We examined the potential benefit of gene therapy in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in which there is embryonic loss of Tsc1 (hamartin) in brain neurons. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (serotype rh8) expressing a tagged form of hamartin was injected into the cerebral ventricles of newborn pups with the genotype Tsc1(cc) (homozygous for a conditional floxed Tsc1 allele) SynI-cre(+), in which Tsc1 is lost selectively in neurons starting at embryonic day 12. Vector-treated Tsc1(cc)SynIcre(+) mice showed a marked improvement in survival from a mean of 22 days in non-injected mice to 52 days in AAV hamartin vector-injected mice, with improved weight gain and motor behavior in the latter. Pathologic studies showed normalization of neuron size and a decrease in markers of mTOR activation in treated as compared to untreated mutant littermates. Hence, we show that gene replacement in the brain is an effective therapeutic approach in this mouse model of TSC1. Our strategy for gene therapy has the advantages that therapy can be achieved from a single application, as compared to repeated treatment with drugs, and that AAV vectors have been found to have minimal to no toxicity in clinical trials for other neurologic conditions. Although there are many additional issues to be addressed, our studies support gene therapy as a useful approach in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 genes and characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous growths in multiple organ systems. We have inactivated Tsc1 in the mouse germ line by gene targeting in ES cells and confirmed that the mutant allele (Tsc1-) has a recessive embryonic lethal phenotype. We found that a significant number (approximately 27%) of heterozygous (Tsc1+/-) mice on the C57BL/6 background died before weaning (P = 0.014) and show that these mice die in the post-natal period (P = 0.033), normally at 1-2 days, from unknown causes. Forty-four percent (7/16) of Tsc1+/- mice on a C3H background developed macroscopically visible renal lesions as early as 3-6 months, increasing to 95% (37/39) by 15-18 months. Renal lesions progressed from cysts through cystadenomas to solid carcinomas. Eighty percent (16/20) of Tsc1+/- mice on a Balb/c background exhibited solid renal cell carcinomas (RCC) by 15-18 months and in 41%, RCCs were > or = 5 mm, resulting in grossly deformed kidneys. Some RCCs had a sarcomatoid morphology of spindle cells in whorled patterns and metastasized to the lungs. We detected loss of the wild-type Tsc1 allele and elevated levels of p-mTOR and p-S6 in lesions from Tsc1+/- mice. This new murine model of hamartin deficiency exhibits a more severe phenotype than existing models.",

    "abstract": "Perinuclear aggresome formation is a key mechanism to dispose of misfolded proteins that exceed the degradative capacity of ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems. Functional blockade of either degradative system leads to an enhanced aggresome formation. The tuberous sclerosis complex-Ras homologue enriched in brain-mammalian target of rapamycin (TSC-Rheb-mTOR) pathway is known to play a central role in modulating protein synthesis and autophagy. However, in spite of the constitutive activation of mTOR and the abrogated autophagy activity in TSC1- or TSC2-deficient cells, the TSC mutant cells are defective in aggresome formation and undergo apoptosis upon misfolded protein accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. High Rheb activity in TSC mutant cells inhibits aggresome formation and sensitizes cell death in response to misfolded proteins. Surprisingly, this previously unrecognized function of Rheb is independent of TOR complex 1. Active Rheb disrupts the interaction between dynein and misfolded protein cargos, and therefore blocks aggresome formation by inhibiting dynein-dependent transportation of misfolded proteins. This study reveals a function of Rheb in controlling misfolded protein metabolism by modulating aggresome formation.",

Previously, we showed that pathogenic tuberin amino-acid substitutions disrupt the tuberin-hamartin complex.

    "title": "Intestinal Epithelial-Specific mTORC1 Activation Enhances Intestinal Adaptation After Small Bowel Resection.",
    "issue": "3(2)",
    "pages": "231-244",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nIntestinal adaptation is a compensatory response to the massive loss of small intestine after surgical resection. We investigated the role of intestinal epithelial cell-specific mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (i-mTORC1) in intestinal adaptation after massive small bowel resection (SBR).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed 50% proximal SBR on mice to study adaptation. To manipulate i-mTORC1 activity, Villin-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 or Raptor mice to inducibly activate or inactivate i-mTORC1 activity with tamoxifen. Western blot was used to confirm the activity of mTORC1. Crypt depth and villus height were measured to score adaptation. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate differentiation and rates of crypt proliferation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter SBR, mice treated with systemic rapamycin showed diminished structural adaptation, blunted crypt cell proliferation, and significant body weight loss. Activating i-mTORC1 via TSC1 deletion induced larger hyperproliferative crypts and disorganized Paneth cells without a significant change in villus height. After SBR, ablating TSC1 in intestinal epithelium induced a robust villus growth with much stronger crypt cell proliferation, but similar body weight recovery. Acute inactivation of i-mTORC1 through deletion of Raptor did not change crypt cell proliferation or mucosa structure, but significantly reduced lysozyme/matrix metalloproteinase-7-positive Paneth cell and goblet cell numbers, with increased enteroendocrine cells. Surprisingly, ablation of intestinal epithelial cell-specific Raptor after SBR did not affect adaptation or crypt proliferation, but dramatically reduced body weight recovery after surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSystemic, but not intestinal-specific, mTORC1 is important for normal adaptation responses to SBR. Although not required, forced enterocyte mTORC1 signaling after resection causes an enhanced adaptive response.",

    "abstract": "Mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 causes the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis, in which widespread hamartomas are seen, some of which have a high level of vascularization. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene products negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. We found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by Tsc1- or Tsc2-null fibroblasts at high levels compared with wild-type cells. In Tsc1+/- mice, serum levels of VEGF were increased and appeared to be associated with the extent of tumor development. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, reduced the production of VEGF by Tsc1- and Tsc2-null fibroblasts to normal levels. Moreover, short-term treatment of Tsc1+/- mice with rapamycin at 20 mg/kg led to some changes in tumor morphology and a reduction in serum VEGF levels. These observations have three implications. First, TSC gene products regulate VEGF production through a mTOR signaling pathway. Second, serum VEGF levels may be a useful clinical biomarker to monitor the progression of TSC-associated lesions. Last, rapamycin or related inhibitors of mTOR may have therapeutic benefit in TSC both by direct tumor cell killing and by inhibiting the development of TSC lesions through impairment of VEGF production.",

    "issue": "33(6)",
    "pages": "2419-31",
    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) hyperactivity in perinatal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) heterozygote mice leads to heterotopia and abnormal neuronal morphogenesis as seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Considering that pathological hyperactive mTOR also occurs in individuals carrying no genetic mutations, we examined whether increasing mTOR activity in neonatal NPCs of wild-type mice would recapitulate the above phenotypes. Electroporation of a plasmid encoding constitutively active Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb(CA)) into subventricular zone NPCs increased mTOR activity in newborn cells. At 19 d post-electroporation (dpe), heterotopia and ectopic cells with a neuronal morphology were observed along the migratory path [rostral migratory stream (RMS)] and in the olfactory bulb (OB). These ectopic cells displayed action potentials and received synaptic inputs identifying them as synaptically integrated neurons. RMS heterotopias contained astrocytes, neurons, and entrapped neuroblasts. Immunostaining at 3 dpe revealed the presence of Mash1(+) Olig2(-) cells in the migratory route accompanied by ectopic neuronal differentiation and altered direction and speed of neuroblast migration at 7 dpe, suggesting a non-cell-autonomous disruption of migration. At >19 dpe, newborn Rheb(CA)-expressing neurons displayed altered distribution and formed micronodules in the OB. In addition, they displayed increased dendritic complexity along with altered membrane biophysics and increased frequency of GABAergic synaptic inputs. OB heterotopia, micronodules, and dendrite hypertrophy were notably prevented by rapamycin treatment, suggesting their mTOR dependence. Collectively, these data show that increasing mTOR activity in neonatal NPCs of wild-type mice recapitulate the pathologies observed in Tsc1 mutant mice. In addition, increased mTOR activity in individuals without known mutations could significantly impact neurogenesis and circuit formation.",

    "pages": "425-36",
    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity in older people is the leading cause of metabolic syndromes. Central neurons serving as homeostatic sensors for body-weight control include hypothalamic neurons that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). Here, we report an age-dependent increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in POMC neurons that elevates the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel activity cell-autonomously to silence POMC neurons. Systemic or intracerebral administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin causes weight loss in old mice. Intracerebral rapamycin infusion into old mice enhances the excitability and neurite projection of POMC neurons, thereby causing a reduction of food intake and body weight. Conversely, young mice lacking the mTOR-negative regulator TSC1 in POMC neurons, but not those lacking TSC1 in NPY/AgRP neurons, were obese. Our study reveals that an increase in mTOR signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons contributes to age-dependent obesity.",

    "issue": "4(6)",
    "pages": "918-26",
    "abstract": "Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) have been developed as anticancer drugs and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In this study, we have examined the effects of FTIs on Tsc-null cells to gain insight into their effects on farnesylated Rheb GTPase. This protein is involved in the activation of mTOR/S6K signaling and is down-regulated by the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex. Both Tsc1(-/-) and Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit constitutive activation of S6K and grow in the absence of serum. Two different FTI compounds, the clinical compound BMS-214662 and the newly described BMS-225975, inhibit the constitutive activation of mTOR/S6K signaling and block serum-free growth of the Tsc-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We have also found that Tsc-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts grow under anchorage-independent conditions and that both FTI compounds inhibit this soft agar growth. These FTI effects are similar to those observed with rapamycin. Another interesting phenotype of Tsc-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts is that they are round and contain actin filaments predominantly at the cell periphery. The addition of FTIs, but not rapamycin, led to the reappearance of intracellular actin filaments and reduction of peripheral actin filaments. The ability of FTI to rearrange actin filaments seems to be largely mediated by the inhibition of Rheb protein, as induction of intracellular actin filaments by FTI was much less efficient in Tsc2-null cells expressing Rheb (M184L), a geranylgeranylated mutant Rheb that can bypass farnesylation. These results reveal that FTIs inhibit Rheb, causing two different effects in Tsc-deficient cells, one on growth and the other on actin filament distribution.",

This study aims to describe the cutaneous signs of TSC with the genotype.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied the dermatological characteristics of 38 patients with TSC at the University Hospital of Montpellier. We collected details of genotypic features.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll the patients presented at least one cutaneous sign. The dermatological examination alone was sufficient to establish a definite diagnosis of TSC based on the diagnostic criteria for 34/38 patients. No association was found between cutaneous signs and the presence of a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation. We noted skin signs that were poorly described in the disease, namely epidermal nevus in 3 patients, vascular malformation in 2 patients, and keratosis pilaris in 9 patients.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nWhile several studies demonstrate a more severe neurological phenotype in TSC2 mutated patients, skin expression does not appear to differ according to the mutated gene. Further case reports and molecular genetic studies are needed to determine the link between epidermal nevus, vascular malformations, keratosis pilaris and TSC.",

    "issue": "9(2)",

    "abstract": "Fibrous papules of the face are hamartomas characterized by stellate-shaped stromal cells, multinucleated giant cells, and proliferative blood vessels in the dermis. The pathogenesis of fibrous papules remains unclear. There is a striking microscopic resemblance between fibrous papules and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated angiofibromas. A germline mutation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, leading to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, accounts for the pathogenesis of TSC-associated angiofibromas. Activated mTOR subsequently activates p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) by phosphorylation. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, is effective in treating TSC-associated angiofibromas. The aim of this study was to understand whether the mTOR pathway is activated in fibrous papules. We studied immunoexpressions of phosphorylated (p-) mTOR effectors in fibrous papules, TSC-associated angiofibromas, and normal skin controls. P-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-S6 were highly expressed in dermal stromal cells and epidermal keratinocytes in fibrous papules and TSC-associated angiofibromas but not in fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes of normal skin controls (p<0.001). The results suggest topical rapamycin may be a novel treatment option for fibrous papules.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in astrocytes occur in the brains of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. Here, we report that knock-out mice with Tsc1 gene inactivation in glia (Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice) exhibit decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, Cx43, and an associated impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes. Correspondingly, hippocampal slices from Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice have increased extracellular potassium concentration in response to stimulation. This impaired potassium buffering can be attributed to abnormal gap junction coupling, as a gap junction inhibitor elicits an additional increase in potassium concentration in control, but not Tsc1(GFAP)CKO slices. Furthermore, treatment with a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor reverses the deficient Cx43 expression and impaired potassium buffering. These findings suggest that Tsc1 inactivation in astrocytes causes defects in astrocytic gap junction coupling and potassium clearance, which may contribute to epilepsy in Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice.",

    "issue": "29(3)",
    "pages": "640-9",
    "abstract": "The stimulatory effect of insulin on protein synthesis is due to its ability to activate various translation factors. We now show that insulin can increase protein synthesis capacity also by translational activation of TOP mRNAs encoding various components of the translation machinery. This translational activation involves the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), as the knockout of TSC1 or TSC2 rescues TOP mRNAs from translational repression in mitotically arrested cells. Similar results were obtained upon overexpression of Rheb, an immediate TSC1-TSC2 target. The role of mTOR, a downstream effector of Rheb, in translational control of TOP mRNAs has been extensively studied, albeit with conflicting results. Even though rapamycin fully blocks mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase activity, the response of TOP mRNAs to this drug varies from complete resistance to high sensitivity. Here we show that mTOR knockdown blunts the translation efficiency of TOP mRNAs in insulin-treated cells, thus unequivocally establishing a role for mTOR in this mode of regulation. However, knockout of the raptor or rictor gene has only a slight effect on the translation efficiency of these mRNAs, implying that mTOR exerts its effect on TOP mRNAs through a novel pathway with a minor, if any, contribution of the canonical mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that raptor knockout renders the translation of TOP mRNAs rapamycin hypersensitive.",

    "issue": "6(4)",
    "pages": "e18583",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUrothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized by frequent gene mutations of which activating mutations in FGFR3 are the most frequent. Several downstream targets of FGFR3 are also mutated in UC, e.g., PIK3CA, AKT1, and RAS. Most mutation studies of UCs have been focused on single or a few genes at the time or been performed on small sample series. This has limited the possibility to investigate co-occurrence of mutations.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nWe performed mutation analyses of 16 genes, FGFR3, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 PTEN, AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ARAF, RAF1, TSC1, TSC2, APC, CTNNB1, and TP53, in 145 cases of UC. We show that FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations are positively associated. In addition, we identified PIK3R1 as a target for mutations. We demonstrate a negative association at borderline significance between FGFR3 and RAS mutations, and show that these mutations are not strictly mutually exclusive. We show that mutations in BRAF, ARAF, RAF1 rarely occurs in UC. Our data emphasize the possible importance of APC signaling as 6% of the investigated tumors either showed inactivating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations. TSC1, as well as TSC2, that constitute the mTOR regulatory tuberous sclerosis complex were found to be mutated at a combined frequency of 15%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nOur data demonstrate a significant association between FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations in UC. Moreover, the identification of mutations in PIK3R1 further emphasizes the importance of the PI3-kinase pathway in UC. The presence of TSC2 mutations, in addition to TSC1 mutations, underlines the involvement of mTOR signaling in UC.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells, but the mechanisms are not well understood. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) controls cell growth and proliferation and plays a critical role in metabolic reprogramming in glioma. mTORC2 regulates cellular processes such as cell survival, metabolism, and proliferation by phosphorylation of AGC kinases. Components of mTORC2 are shown to localize to the nucleus, but whether mTORC2 modulates epigenetic modifications to regulate gene expression is not known. Here, we identified histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56Ac) is regulated by mTORC2 and show that global H3K56Ac levels were downregulated on mTORC2 knockdown but not on mTORC1 knockdown. mTORC2 promotes H3K56Ac in a tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2) mediated signaling pathway. We show that knockdown of sirtuin6 (SIRT6) prevented H3K56 deacetylation in mTORC2 depleted cells. Using glioma model consisting of U87EGFRvIII cells, we established that mTORC2 promotes H3K56Ac in glioma. Finally, we show that mTORC2 regulates the expression of glycolytic genes by regulating H3K56Ac levels at the promoters of these genes in glioma cells and depletion of mTOR leads to increased recruitment of SIRT6 to these promoters. Collectively, these results identify mTORC2 signaling pathway positively promotes H3K56Ac through which it may mediate metabolic reprogramming in glioma.",

    "abstract": "Sublethal ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a powerful inducer of ischemic brain tolerance. However, its underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In this study, we chose four different IPC paradigms, namely 5 min (5 min duration), 5×5 min (5 min duration, 2 episodes, 15-min interval), 5×5×5 min (5 min duration, 3 episodes, 15-min intervals), and 15 min (15 min duration), and demonstrated that three episodes of 5 min IPC activated autophagy to the greatest extent 24 h after IPC, as evidenced by Beclin expression and LC3-I/II conversion. Autophagic activation was mediated by the tuberous sclerosis type 1 (TSC1)-mTor signal pathway as IPC increased TSC1 but decreased mTor phosphorylation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed that IPC protected against cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Critically, 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, abolished the neuroprotection of IPC and, by contrast, rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, potentiated it. Cleaved caspase-3 expression, neurological scores, and infarct volume in different groups further confirmed the protection of IPC against I/R injury. Taken together, our data indicate that autophagy activation might underlie the protection of IPC against ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptosis.",

    "title": "Regression of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas with RAD001 (Everolimus) in tuberous sclerosis complex.",
    "issue": "27(1)",
    "pages": "179-81",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and characterized by slow-growing tumors in multiple organs. Of the affected individuals, 10% display subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), which can lead to substantial neurological morbidity. The TSC1/TSC2 protein complex is a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Hence, mutations in these genes in preclinical models are associated with increased mTOR pathway activation and heightened sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. We hereby report our experience with RAD001 (Everolimus) therapy, a novel mTOR inhibitor, in inducing a dramatic regression of SEGAs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA patient with TSC and SEGAs was treated with 10 mg/day oral RAD001. MRIs and neuro-ophthalmological exams were performed before and at regular intervals following the initiation of therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe lesions exhibited significant regression in several tumor locations and stabilization in others, accompanied with an improvement of his visual status. Treatment was well tolerated for 11 months but was than discontinued due to hypertension and elevated CPK, without evidence for rhabdomyolysis. Yet, during 9 months following the interruption of therapy, SEGAs remained unchanged.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOral RAD001 demonstrated preliminary encouraging results as treatment of astrocytomas associated with TSC. These preliminary results were recently supported by the Novartis announcement of the phase II study of RAD001 for SEGAs, which was not published yet. According to their statement, 75% of the patients showed reduction of SEGAs' volume following treatment with RAD001. Based on these results, RAD001 may be an alternative to surgery in selected patients with TSC and SEGAs.",

    "issue": "84(1)",
    "pages": "78-91",
    "abstract": "Abnormal dendritic complexity is a shared feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders associated with neurological defects. Here, we found that the actin-crosslinking protein filamin A (FLNA) is overexpressed in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mice, a PI3K-mTOR model of neurodevelopmental disease that is associated with abnormal dendritic complexity. Both under- and overexpression of FLNA in wild-type neurons led to more complex dendritic arbors in vivo, suggesting that an optimal level of FLNA expression is required for normal dendritogenesis. In Tsc1(null) neurons, knocking down FLNA in vivo prevented dendritic abnormalities. Surprisingly, FLNA overexpression in Tsc1(null) neurons was dependent on MEK1/2 but not mTOR activity, despite both pathways being hyperactive. In addition, increasing MEK-ERK1/2 activity led to dendritic abnormalities via FLNA, and decreasing MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in Tsc1(null) neurons rescued dendritic defects. These data demonstrate that altered FLNA expression increases dendritic complexity and contributes to pathologic dendritic patterning in TSC in an mTOR-independent, ERK1/2-dependent manner.",

    "issue": "286(37)",
    "pages": "32651-60",
    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that plays a key role in a wide array of cellular processes and exists in two distinct functional complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Although mTORC2 is primarily activated by growth factors, mTORC1 is regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular signals such as nutrients, growth factors, and cellular redox. Previous study has shown that cysteine oxidants sufficiently activate mTORC1 activity under amino acid-depleted conditions and that a reducing agent effectively suppresses amino acid-induced mTORC1 activity, thereby raising the possibility that redox-sensitive mechanisms underlie amino acid-dependent mTORC1 regulation. However, the molecular mechanism by which redox regulates mTORC1 activity is not well understood. In this study, we show that the redox-sensitive regulation of mTORC1 occurs via Rheb but not the Rag small GTPase. Enhancing cellular redox potential with cysteine oxidants significantly increases Rheb GTP levels. Importantly, modulation of the cellular redox potential with a cysteine oxidant or reducing agent failed to alter mTORC1 activity in TSC1(-/-) or TSC2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Furthermore, a cysteine oxidant has little effect on mTOR localization but sufficiently activates mTORC1 activity in both p18(-/-) and control mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, suggesting that the redox-sensitive regulation of mTORC1 occurs independent of the Ragulator·Rag complex. Taken together, our results suggest that the TSC complex plays an important role in redox-sensitive mTORC1 regulation and argues for the activation of mTORC1 in places other than the lysosome upon inhibition of the TSC complex.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of mitogenic pathways has led to the parallel requirement for negative control mechanisms, which prevent aberrant growth and the development of cancer. Principally, such negative control mechanisms are represented by tumor suppressor genes, which normally act to constrain cell proliferation (Macleod, K. 2000. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 10:81-93). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder, characterized by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, whose gene products hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2) constitute a putative tumor suppressor complex (TSC1-2; van Slegtenhorst, M., M. Nellist, B. Nagelkerken, J. Cheadle, R. Snell, A. van den Ouweland, A. Reuser, J. Sampson, D. Halley, and P. van der Sluijs. 1998. Hum. Mol. Genet. 7:1053-1057). Little is known with regard to the oncogenic target of TSC1-2, however recent genetic studies in Drosophila have shown that S6 kinase (S6K) is epistatically dominant to TSC1-2 (Tapon, N., N. Ito, B.J. Dickson, J.E. Treisman, and I.K. Hariharan. 2001. Cell. 105:345-355; Potter, C.J., H. Huang, and T. Xu. 2001. Cell. 105:357-368). Here we show that loss of TSC2 function in mammalian cells leads to constitutive S6K1 activation, whereas ectopic expression of TSC1-2 blocks this response. Although activation of wild-type S6K1 and cell proliferation in TSC2-deficient cells is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), by using an S6K1 variant (GST-DeltaC-S6K1), which is uncoupled from mTOR signaling, we demonstrate that TSC1-2 does not inhibit S6K1 via mTOR. Instead, we show by using wortmannin and dominant interfering alleles of phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) that increased S6K1 activation is contingent upon the suppression of TSC2 function by PI3K in normal cells and is PI3K independent in TSC2-deficient cells.",

    "issue": "41(9)",
    "pages": "3677-82",
    "abstract": "Herein we have reported the use of rapamycin in immunosuppressive treatment after renal transplantation as a therapy of choice in a patient with diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a genetic disorder, caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, create a complex that inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein engaged in regulation of the cell cycle. Mutations of TSC genes lead to constitutive activation of mTOR resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cells. As a consequence malformations of many organs arise. We have presented a case of a 47-year-old female TSC patient with multisystem involvement (skin, brain, lungs, and kidneys), who developed end-stage renal disease ESRD due to angiomyolipomas with subsequent bilateral nephrectomy. At the age of 44 years, she started hemodialysis treatments and 10 months later underwent kidney transplantation. Immunosuppressive treatment included the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Since the patient was discharged from hospital, she has remained in good clinical condition with stable graft function. Clinical evaluation after 2 years treatment with rapamycin revealed significant regression of skin lesions. Brain, chest, and abdominal cavity computed tomography images remained stable. No complications of immunosuppressive treatment or TSC were observed. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed that rapamycin exerts beneficial effects in TSC, providing a new therapeutic option. Therefore an immunosuppressive regimen with rapamycin should be considered as the treatment of choice after kidney transplantation among patients with TSC seeking to avoid development or progression of disease complications.",

    "issue": "191(2)",
    "pages": "699-707",
    "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is characterized by upregulation of cell-surface MHC class II (MHC-II) and costimulatory molecules, and production of a variety of cytokines that can shape both innate and adaptive immunity. Paradoxically, transcription of the MHC-II genes, as well as its activator, CIITA, is rapidly silenced during DC maturation. The mechanisms that control CIITA/MHC-II expression and silencing have not been fully understood. We report in this article that the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a critical regulator of DC function for both innate and adaptive immunity. Its deficiency in DCs results in increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling, altered cytokine production, impaired CIITA/MHC-II expression, and defective Ag presentation to CD4 T cells after TLR4 stimulation. We demonstrate further that IFN regulatory factor 4 can directly bind to CIITA promoters, and decreased IFN regulatory factor 4 expression is partially responsible for decreased CIITA/MHC-II expression in TSC1-deficient DCs. Moreover, we identify that CIITA/MHC-II silencing during DC maturation requires mTOR complex 1 activity. Together, our data reveal unexpected roles of TSC1/mTOR that control multifaceted functions of DCs.",

    "issue": "6(3)",
    "pages": "255-66",
    "abstract": "Cells encountering hypoxic stress conserve resources and energy by downregulating the protein synthesis. Here we demonstrate that one mechanism in this response is the translational repression of TOP mRNAs that encode components of the translational apparatus. This mode of regulation involves TSC and Rheb, as knockout of TSC1 or TSC2 or overexpression of Rheb rescued TOP mRNA translation in oxygen-deprived cells. Stress-induced translational repression of these mRNAs closely correlates with the hypophosphorylated state of 4E-BP, a translational repressor. However, a series of 4E-BP loss- and gain-of-function experiments disprove a cause-and-effect relationship between the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP and the translational repression of TOP mRNAs under oxygen or growth factor deprivation. Furthermore, the repressive effect of anoxia is similar to that attained by the very efficient inhibition of mTOR activity by Torin 1, but much more pronounced than raptor or rictor knockout. Likewise, deficiency of raptor or rictor, even though it mildly downregulated basal translation efficiency of TOP mRNAs, failed to suppress the oxygen-mediated translational activation of TOP mRNAs. Finally, co-knockdown of TIA-1 and TIAR, two RNA-binding proteins previously implicated in translational repression of TOP mRNAs in amino acid-starved cells, failed to relieve TOP mRNA translation under other stress conditions. Thus, the nature of the proximal translational regulator of TOP mRNAs remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated TSC/mTOR signaling may play a pathogenetic role in forms of syndromic autism, such as autism associated with tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder caused by heterozygous TSC1 or TSC2 mutations. Environmental risk factors, such as gestational viral infections, may, in some cases, also contribute to the pathogenesis of autism and related neuropsychiatric disorders. We have recently found that a heterozygous Tsc2 mutation and the poly I:C model of maternal immune activation (MIA) interactively perturb fetal development and adult social behavior in mice, suggesting that these factors converge on shared pathways. TSC/mTOR signaling plays an important role in the modulation of immune responses, raising the possibility that the damage caused by MIA was greater in Tsc2(+/-) than in wildtype fetuses because of an exacerbated immune response in the mutants. Here, cytokine antibody arrays were employed to measure relative cytokine abundances in the fetal brain and the placenta during MIA. Cytokines were induced by gestational poly I:C but there was no obvious modulatory effect of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency. The data indicate that cytokine exposure during MIA is comparable in Tsc2 haploinsufficient and wildtype control fetuses, suggesting that downstream molecular and cellular processes may account for the interactive effects of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency and MIA.",

    "issue": "81(20)",
    "pages": "11106-15",
    "abstract": "GADD34 is a protein that is induced by a variety of stressors, including DNA damage, heat shock, nutrient deprivation, energy depletion, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we demonstrated that GADD34 induced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection suppressed viral replication in wild-type (WT) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas replication was enhanced in GADD34-deficient (GADD34-KO) MEFs. Enhanced viral replication in GADD34-KO MEFs was reduced by retroviral gene rescue of GADD34. The level of VSV protein expression in GADD34-KO MEFs was significantly higher than that in WT MEFs. Neither phosphorylation of eIF2alpha nor cellular protein synthesis was correlated with viral replication in GADD34-KO MEFs. On the other hand, phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP1, proteins downstream of mTOR, was suppressed by VSV infection in WT MEFs but not in GADD34-KO MEFs. GADD34 was able to associate with TSC1/2 and dephosphorylate TSC2 at Thr1462. VSV replication was higher in TSC2-null cells than in TSC2-expressing cells, and constitutively active Akt enhanced VSV replication. On the other hand, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, significantly suppressed VSV replication in GADD34-KO MEFs. These findings demonstrate that GADD34 induced by VSV infection suppresses viral replication via mTOR pathway inhibition, indicating that cross talk between stress-inducible GADD34 and the mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in antiviral defense.",

    "issue": "28(5)",
    "pages": "835-40",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) represent a family of mesenchymal neoplasms, mechanistically linked through activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. There is no known effective therapy for PEComa, and the molecular pathophysiology of aberrant mTOR signaling provided us with a scientific rationale to target this pathway therapeutically. On this mechanistic basis, we treated three consecutive patients with metastatic PEComa with an oral mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with advanced PEComa were treated with sirolimus and consented to retrospective collection of data from their medical records and analysis of archival tumor specimens. Tumor response was determined by computed tomography scans obtained at the clinical discretion of the treating physicians. Tumors were assessed for immunohistochemical evidence of mTORC1 activation and genetic evidence of alterations in TSC1 and TSC2. Results Radiographic responses to sirolimus were observed in all patients. PEComas demonstrated loss of TSC2 protein expression and evidence of baseline mTORC1 activation. Homozygous loss of TSC1 was identified in one PEComa. CONCLUSION Inhibition of mTORC1, pathologically activated by loss of the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, is a rational mechanistic target for therapy in PEComas. The clinical activity of sirolimus in PEComa additionally strengthens the pathobiologic similarities linking PEComas to other neoplasms related to the tuberous sclerosis complex.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 tumor suppressor proteins have been shown to negatively regulate cell growth through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in integrin signaling. Here we identify a novel interaction between FAK and TSC2 and show that TSC2 is phosphorylated by FAK. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of FAK kinase dead mutant inhibits the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1, two key mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) downstream targets, and negatively regulates the cell size and that FAK regulation of S6K phosphorylation is through TSC2. Finally, we provide data that FAK plays a positive role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation, whereas TSC2 is required for cell suspension-induced S6K inactivation. Together, these results suggest that FAK might regulate S6K activation and cell size through its interaction with and phosphorylation of TSC2 and also provide a previously unappreciated role of TSC2 in the regulation of mTOR signaling by cell adhesion.",

    "abstract": "When deprived of anchorage to the extracellular matrix, fibroblasts arrest in G(1) phase at least in part due to inactivation of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinases. Despite great effort, how anchorage signals control the G(1)-S transition of fibroblasts remains highly elusive. We recently found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade might convey an anchorage signal that regulates S phase entry. Here, we show that Rho-associated kinase connects this signal to the TSC1/TSC2-RHEB-mTOR pathway. Expression of a constitutively active form of ROCK1 suppressed all of the anchorage deprivation effects suppressible by tsc2 mutation in rat embryonic fibroblasts. TSC2 contains one evolutionarily conserved ROCK target-like sequence, and an alanine substitution for Thr(1203) in this sequence severely impaired the ability of ROCK1 to counteract the anchorage loss-imposed down-regulation of both G(1) cell cycle factors and mTORC1 activity. Moreover, TSC2 Thr(1203) underwent ROCK-dependent phosphorylation in vivo and could be phosphorylated by bacterially expressed active ROCK1 in vitro, providing biochemical evidence for a direct physical interaction between ROCK and TSC2.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) forms a heterodimmer with tuberous sclerosis complex 2, to inhibit signalling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). The mTORC1 stimulates cell growth by promoting anabolic cellular processes, such as gene transcription and protein translation, in response to growth factors and nutrient signals. Originally designed to test the role of TSC1 in adipocyte function, mice in which the gene for TSC1 was specifically deleted by the fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4)-Cre (Fabp4-Tsc1cKO mice) died prematurely within 48 h after birth. The Fabp4-Tsc1cKO mouse revealed a much smaller phenotype relative to the wild-type littermates. Maternal administration of rapamycin, a classical mTOR inhibitor, significantly increased the survival time of Fabp4-Tsc1cKO mice for up to 23 days. Both macroscopic and microscopic haemorrhages were observed in the lungs of Fabp4-Tsc1cKO mice, while other tissues showed no significant changes. Levels of surfactant proteins A and B demonstrated a significant decrease in the Fabp4-Tsc1cKO mice, which was rescued by maternal injection of rapamycin. Co-localization of FABP4 or TSC1 with surfactant protein B was also detected in neonatal pulmonary tissues. Our study suggests that TSC1-mTORC1 may be critical for the synthesis of surfactant proteins A and B.",

    "pages": "97-106",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exerts a crucial role in aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely obscure. Results from Tsc1- or Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human cancer cell lines consistently indicate that the expression of glucose transporter 3 (Glut3) is dramatically up-regulated by mTOR. The rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), but not the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), was involved in the regulation of Glut3 expression. Moreover, mTORC1 enhances Glut3 expression through the activation of the IKK/NFκB pathway. Depletion of Glut3 led to the suppression of aerobic glycolysis, the inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation, and the attenuation of the tumorigenic potential of the cells with aberrantly hyper-activated mTORC1 signaling in nude mice. We conclude that Glut3 is a downstream target of mTORC1, and it is critical for oncogenic mTORC1-mediated aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. Hence Glut3 may be a potential target for therapy against cancers caused by the aberrantly activated mTORC1 signaling.",

    "pages": "10",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by seizures, mental retardation and the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, interact to form a protein complex that inhibits signal transduction to the downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe have used a combination of different assays to characterise the effects of a number of pathogenic TSC2 amino acid substitutions on TSC1-TSC2 complex formation and mTOR signalling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe used these assays to compare the effects of 9 different TSC2 variants (S132C, F143L, A196T, C244R, Y598H, I820del, T993M, L1511H and R1772C) identified in individuals with symptoms of TSC from 4 different families. In each case we were able to identify the pathogenic mutation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFunctional characterisation of TSC2 variants can help identify pathogenic changes in individuals with TSC, and assist in the diagnosis and genetic counselling of the index cases and/or other family members.",

    "pages": "3979-90",
    "abstract": "Thymic-derived CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells are essential for the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. Signaling pathways that drive immature thymic progenitors to differentiate into CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg cells need to be elucidated. The precise role of the TSC1/2 complex, a critical negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in thymic CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg-cell development remains elusive. In the present study, we found that the percentage and cell number of thymic CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg cells were significantly increased in T-cell-specific TSC1-knockout (TSC1KO) mice. Nevertheless, the levels of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(-) nTreg precursors in TSC1KO thymus were indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice. TSC1KO CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg cells showed normal cell death but enhanced proliferative response to IL-2 in a STAT5-dependent manner. Rapamycin (Rapa) treatment failed to rescue but rather increased the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg cells in TSC1KO and RictorKO mice. The percentage and cell number of thymic CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg cells were significantly increased in T-cell-specific RictorKO mice but not in PtenKO mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that TSC1 plays an important role in regulating thymic CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) nTreg-cell development via a Rapa-resistant and mTORC2-dependent signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Defects in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Ras)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are responsible for several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are an important cause for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes. We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.",

    "issue": "18(1)",
    "pages": "15",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is the second most common genodermatosis in our country and one of its main characteristics is the presence of facial angiofibromas. These benign tumors can be really bothersome for some patients and there is not a gold-standard treatment. Laser therapy has been used with good responses but it is a painful option and recurrence is guaranteed. TS develops as a result of a mutation of one of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, which encode for hamartin and tuberin, respectively. TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors that inhibit mTOR, which if mutated results in mTOR activation, leading to an increase in protein translation. This eventually induces formation of hamartomatous tumors in patients with TSC. Oral rapamycin had been reported to be effective for the treatment of various tumors, apparently because of its action of inhibiting the m-TOR complex. Recently it has been suggested that the drug may be effective when applied topically. We report the 6th case of facial AF treated with topical rapamycin, 1 percent, once per day. An excellent response was achieved surprisingly rapidly. We propose this option as a safe and effective therapy.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop central nervous system abnormalities that may reflect astrocyte dysfunction. In an effort to model astrocyte dysfunction in TSC, we generated mice lacking Tsc1 (hamartin) expression in astrocytes and demonstrated that Tsc1-null astrocytes exhibit abnormalities in contact inhibition growth arrest. In this study, we demonstrate that hamartin-deficient astrocytes are also defective in cell size regulation. We show that the increase in Tsc1-null astrocyte size is associated with increased activation of the S6-kinase pathway. In keeping with recent reports that the hamartin/tuberin complex may regulate Rheb and downstream S6K activation, we demonstrate that expression of either Rheb or S6K in primary astrocytes results in increased S6 pathway activation, and that inhibition of Rheb activity in Tsc1-deficient astrocytes using either pharmacologic or genetic strategies markedly reduces S6 activation. Collectively, these observations suggest that TSC inactivation in astrocytes results in defective cell size regulation associated with dysregulated Rheb/mTOR/S6K pathway activity.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of approximately one in 6000. It arises from a genetic abnormality involving either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16. The protein product of TSC1 is hamartin and that of TSC2 is tuberin. In cells, hamartin and tuberin form a complex which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central controller of cell growth and proliferation. Angiofibroma affects 70-80% of patients with TSC, typically on the face. We report a patient with TSC with recurrent life-threatening haemorrhage from both kidneys due to extensive angiomyolipoma formation leading to bilateral nephrectomy and renal transplantation. Immunosuppressive treatment with rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, initiated because of renal transplantation, reduced facial angiofibroma dramatically.",

    "issue": "9(10)",
    "pages": "e109410",
    "abstract": "TOP mRNAs encode components of the translational apparatus, and repression of their translation comprises one mechanism, by which cells encountering amino acid deprivation downregulate the biosynthesis of the protein synthesis machinery. This mode of regulation involves TSC as knockout of TSC1 or TSC2 rescued TOP mRNAs translation in amino acid-starved cells. The involvement of mTOR in translational control of TOP mRNAs is demonstrated by the ability of constitutively active mTOR to relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNA upon amino acid deprivation. Consistently, knockdown of this kinase as well as its inhibition by pharmacological means blocked amino acid-induced translational activation of these mRNAs. The signaling of amino acids to TOP mRNAs involves RagB, as overexpression of active RagB derepressed the translation of these mRNAs in amino acid-starved cells. Nonetheless, knockdown of raptor or rictor failed to suppress translational activation of TOP mRNAs by amino acids, suggesting that mTORC1 or mTORC2 plays a minor, if any, role in this mode of regulation. Finally, miR10a has previously been suggested to positively regulate the translation of TOP mRNAs. However, we show here that titration of this microRNA failed to downregulate the basal translation efficiency of TOP mRNAs. Moreover, Drosha knockdown or Dicer knockout, which carries out the first and second processing steps in microRNAs biosynthesis, respectively, failed to block the translational activation of TOP mRNAs by amino acid or serum stimulation. Evidently, these results are questioning the positive role of microRNAs in this mode of regulation.",

Next generation sequencing showed four pathogenic genomic aberrations involving BIRC3, FANCC, TP53, and TSC1 genes. His work-up was negative for metastatic disease; a wide local excision was performed. Including the reported patient, cutaneous PEComa has been described in 65 individuals: primary benign (N=58), primary malignant (N=5), and metastatic malignant (N=2). Cutaneous PEComa typically presented as a painless, slowly growing nodule of &lt;2 centimeters on the lower extremity of a woman in her fifth decade. The neoplasms consisted of epithelioid cells, spindle cells, or both. The most reliable markers were MiTF (100%), HMB45 (94%), and NKIC3 (94%) for melanocytes and smooth muscle actin (43%) and desmin (40%) for smooth muscle. There has been no reported recurrence of a primary cutaneous benign or malignant PEComa after complete excision. Genomic alterations in malignant PEComas frequently involve TSC1 and TSC2 genes (mTOR activators), as well as TFE3 fusions. In November 2021, the FDA approved nab-sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) for PEComas.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 proteins associate with TBC1D7 to form the TSC complex, which is an essential suppressor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a ubiquitous driver of cell and tissue growth. Loss-of-function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, but not TBC1D7, give rise to TSC, a pleiotropic disorder with aberrant activation of mTORC1 in various tissues. Here, we characterize mice with genetic deletion of Tbc1d7, which are viable with normal growth and development. Consistent with partial loss of function of the TSC complex, Tbc1d7 knockout (KO) mice display variable increases in tissue mTORC1 signaling with increased muscle fiber size but with strength and motor defects. Their most pronounced phenotype is brain overgrowth due to thickening of the cerebral cortex, with enhanced neuron-intrinsic mTORC1 signaling and growth. Thus, TBC1D7 is required for full TSC complex function in tissues, and the brain is particularly sensitive to its growth-suppressing activities.",

    "pages": "e60014",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a multisystem disease of women, is manifest by the proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells in the lung resulting in cystic lung destruction. Women with LAM can also develop renal angiomyolipomas. LAM is caused by mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex genes (TSC1 or TSC2), resulting in hyperactive mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. The mTOR inhibitor, Rapamycin, stabilizes lung function in LAM and decreases the volume of renal angiomyolipomas, but lung function declines and angiomyolipomas regrow when treatment is discontinued, suggesting that factors induced by mTORC1 inhibition may promote the survival of TSC2-deficient cells. Whether microRNA (miRNA, miR) signaling is involved in the response of LAM to mTORC1 inhibition is unknown. We identified Rapamycin-dependent miRNA in LAM patient angiomyolipoma-derived cells using two separate screens. First, we assayed 132 miRNA of known significance to tumor biology. Using a cut-off of >1.5-fold change, 48 microRNA were Rapamycin-induced, while 4 miRs were downregulated. In a second screen encompassing 946 miRNA, 18 miRs were upregulated by Rapamycin, while eight were downregulated. Dysregulation of miRs 29b, 21, 24, 221, 106a and 199a were common to both platforms and were classified as candidate \"RapamiRs.\" Validation by qRT-PCR confirmed that these microRNA were increased. miR-21, a pro-survival miR, was the most significantly increased by mTOR-inhibition (p<0.01). The regulation of miR-21 by Rapamycin is cell type independent. mTOR inhibition promotes the processing of the miR-21 transcript (pri-miR-21) to a premature form (pre-miR-21). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that Rapamycin upregulates multiple miRs, including pro-survival miRs, in TSC2-deficient patient-derived cells. The induction of miRs may contribute to the response of LAM and TSC patients to Rapamycin therapy.",

Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for TSC. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a physical and functional complex and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth promoting pathway. mTORC1 plays an essential role in a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription, trafficking and autophagy. In this review, we will discuss recent progresses in the TSC-mTOR field and their physiological functions and alterations of this pathway in pathophysiology.",

As these genes work in concert to negatively regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase which is involved in protein translation, mutations of these genes lead to a disinhibited mTOR activity. Both the clinical appearance of this condition including tumors, cognitive decline, and epileptic seizures and the molecular understanding of the mTOR signaling pathway, not only involved in cell growth, but also in neuronal functioning, have inspired numerous studies on learning behavior as well as on synaptic plasticity which is the key molecular mechanism of information storage in the brain. A couple of interesting animal models have been established, and the data obtained in these animals will be discussed. A special focus will be laid on differences among these models, which may be in part due to different background strains, but also may indicate pathophysiological variation in different mutations.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) form a family of rare mesenchymal neoplasms that typically display myomelanocytic differentiation. Upregulation of mTOR signaling due the inactivation of TSC1/2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 1 and 2) is believed to be a key oncogenic driver in this disease. Recently, a subgroup of PEComas harboring TFE3 (Transcription Factor E3) rearrangements and presenting with a distinctive morphology has been identified. TSC1/2 and TFE3 aberrations are deemed to be mutually exclusive in PEComa, with two different pathogenic mechanisms assumed to lead to tumorigenesis. Here, we challenge this dichotomy by presenting a case of a clinically aggressive TCS1-mutated PEComa displaying a TFE3-altered phenotype. FISH analysis was suggestive of a TFE3 inversion; however, RNA and whole genome sequencing was ultimately unable to identify a fusion involving the gene. However, a copy number increase of the chromosomal region encompassing TFE3 was detected and transcriptome analysis confirmed upregulation of TFE3, which was also seen at the protein level. Therefore, we believe that the TSC1/2-mTOR pathway and TFE3 overexpression can simultaneously contribute to tumorigenesis in PEComa. Our comprehensive genetic analyses add to the understanding of the complex pathogenic mechanisms underlying PEComa and harbor insights for clinical treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade enhanced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling cascade has been identified in focal malformations of cortical development (MCD) subtypes, which have been collectively referred to as \"mTORopathies.\" Mutations in mTOR regulatory genes (e.g., TSC1, TSC2, AKT3, DEPDC5) have been associated with several focal MCD highly associated with epilepsy such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hemimegalencephaly (HME; brain malformation associated with dramatic enlargement of one brain hemisphere), and cortical dysplasia. mTOR plays important roles in the regulation of cell division, growth, and survival, and, thus, aberrant activation of the cascade during cortical development can cause dramatic alterations in cell size, cortical lamination, and axon and dendrite outgrowth often observed in focal MCD. Although it is widely believed that structural alterations induced by hyperactivated mTOR signaling are critical for epileptogenesis, newer evidence suggests that mTOR activation on its own may enhance neuronal excitability. Clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors have shown efficacy in the treatment of seizures associated with focal MCD.",

    "abstract": "The signalling components upstream and downstream of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are frequently altered in a wide variety of human diseases. Upstream of mTOR key signalling molecules are the small GTPase Ras, the lipid kinase PI3K, the Akt kinase, and the GTPase Rheb, which are known to be deregulated in many human cancers. Mutations in the mTOR pathway component genes TSC1, TSC2, LKB1, PTEN, VHL, NF1 and PKD1 trigger the development of the syndromes tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, Proteus syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Polycystic kidney disease, respectively. In addition, the tuberous sclerosis proteins have been implicated in the development of several sporadic tumors and in the control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, known to be of relevance for several cancers. Recently, it has been recognized that mTOR is regulated by TNF-alpha and Wnt, both of which have been shown to play critical roles in the development of many human neoplasias. In addition to all these human diseases, the role of mTOR in Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed.",

    "issue": "13(1)",
    "pages": "14",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a multi-system genetic disorder often associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2, which lead to constitutive overactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In several Tsc1+/- and Tsc2+/- animal models, cognitive and social behavior deficits were reversed by mTOR inhibitors. However, phase II studies have not shown amelioration of ASD and cognitive deficits in individuals with TSC during mTOR inhibitor therapy. We asked here if developmental epilepsy, common in the majority of individuals with TSC but absent in most animal models, could explain the discrepancy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt postnatal day P12, developmental status epilepticus (DSE) was induced in male Tsc2+/- (Eker) and wild-type rats, establishing four experimental groups including controls. In adult animals (n = 36), the behavior was assessed in the paradigms of social interaction test, elevated plus-maze, light-dark test, Y-maze, and novel object recognition. The testing was carried out before medication (T1), during a 2-week treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (T2) and after an 8-week washing-out (T3). Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded in a separate set of animals (n = 18).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth Tsc2+/- mutation and DSE caused social behavior deficits and epileptiform EEG abnormalities (T1). Everolimus led to a persistent improvement of the social deficit induced by Tsc2+/-, while deficits related to DSE did not respond to everolimus (T2, T3).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings may contribute to an explanation why ASD symptoms in individuals with TSC, where comorbid early-onset epilepsy is common, were not reliably ameliorated by mTOR inhibitors in clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Cell proliferation and apoptosis are typical hallmarks of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and cause the development of kidney cysts that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Many factors, impaired by polycystin complex loss of function, may promote these biological processes, including cAMP, mTOR, and EGFR signaling pathways. In addition, microRNAs (miRs) may also regulate the ADPKD related signaling network and their dysregulation contributes to disease progression. However, the role of miRs in ADPKD pathogenesis has not been fully understood, but also the function of p53 is quite obscure, especially its regulatory contribution on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we describe for the first time that miR501-5p, upregulated in ADPKD cells and tissues, induces the activation of mTOR kinase by PTEN and TSC1 gene repression. The increased activity of mTOR kinase enhances the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that in turn promotes p53 ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by proteasome machinery in a network involving p70S6K. Moreover, the overexpression of miR501-5p stimulates cell proliferation in kidney cells by the inhibition of p53 function in a mechanism driven by mTOR signaling. In fact, the downregulation of this miR as well as the pharmacological treatment with proteasome and mTOR inhibitors in ADPKD cells reduces cell growth by the activation of apoptosis. Consequently, the stimulation of cell death in ADPKD cells may occur through the inhibition of mTOR/MDM2 signaling and the restoring of p53 function. The data presented here confirm that the impaired mTOR signaling plays an important role in ADPKD.",

    "issue": "28(2)",
    "pages": "95-103",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe exact cell of origin of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is debated but most currently consider the tumor in the astrocytic category. Mutations and subsequent biallelic inactivation of TSC1 encoding hamartin, or TSC2 encoding tuberin appear to be the underlying genetic aberrations. Inactivation leads to loss of proteins that inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR ) disrupting tightly regulated cell functions.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nWe analyzed the expression of tuberin and hamartin along with an array of neuroepithelial markers in 9 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In addition, RPS6 and 4EBP1 regulatory proteins that are downstream in the mTOR pathway were also evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhile hamartin and tuberin expression levels were relatively decreased compared to control tissue, this was not of particular practical use to detect the mutated gene since low levels of positivity could be detected throughout the central nervous system. As expected, the levels of RPS6 and 4EBP1 were increased, further confirming the activation of the mTOR pathway. GFAP was positive in 5 cases, while Synaptophysin positivity was found in all tumors. CD34 (a marker often observed in well differentiated glio-neuronal tumors), Olig2 (a nuclear marker present in most gliomas), IDH1 and IDH2 were entirely negative in all tumor cells. Ki67 (MIB-1) showed a low proliferation rate ranging from 2% to 8%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nStaining with neuroepithelial markers supports the suggestion of ambiguous differentiation. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas do not appear to have the typical expression profiles of astrocytic tumors, under which they have been classified.",

    "issue": "26(4)",
    "pages": "259-66",
    "abstract": "TSC1 and TSC2 are two recently identified tumor suppressor genes encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis, a neurological disorder linked with the development of hamartomas in numerous organs, including the brain, kidneys, heart, and liver. Both protein products of TSC1 and TSC2 form an intracellular complex exerting GTPase-activating (GAP) activity towards a small G protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain). Inhibition of Rheb is important for the positive regulation of mTOR pathway, while mutations of hamartin or tuberin result in uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Although the precise role for the TSC1/2 complex in tumor suppression is not clear, many studies have established a link with the regulation of transcription and protein biosynthesis, increasing susceptibility to apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell cycle control. We describe the development of a monoclonal antibody specific towards TSC2/tuberin and characterize the suitability for Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent applications. The C-terminal region of TSC2 was expressed as a His-tag fusion protein in bacteria, affinity purified and used as an immunogen. Hybrid myelomas were produced from the spleenocytes of immunized mice and SP2/0 myeloma cells. Testing the specificity of cell culture supernatants from generated hybridomas towards recombinant His-TSC2C in ELISA assay allowed us to isolate a panel of positive clones. Further analysis of selected clones by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation revealed one clone, termed D6, which specifically recognized recombinant and endogenous TSC2. The specificity of generated antibody was also confirmed in TSC2(/) and TSC2(+/+) mouse embryo fibroblasts. In summary, the produced antibody is a useful tool in our research program and will be available for researchers investigating signal transduction pathways involving TSC1/2 signaling under physiological conditions and in human pathologies.",

    "issue": "14(12)",
    "pages": "1092-7",
    "abstract": "Recent groundbreaking discoveries have revealed that IGF-1, Ras, MEK, AMPK, TSC1/2, FOXO, PI3K, mTOR, S6K, and NFκB are involved in the aging process. This is remarkable because the same signaling molecules, oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, are well-known targets for cancer therapy. Furthermore, anti-cancer drugs aimed at some of these targets have been already developed. This arsenal could be potentially employed for anti-aging interventions (given that similar signaling molecules are involved in both cancer and aging). In cancer, intrinsic and acquired resistance, tumor heterogeneity, adaptation, and genetic instability of cancer cells all hinder cancer-directed therapy. But for anti-aging applications, these hurdles are irrelevant. For example, since anti-aging interventions should be aimed at normal postmitotic cells, no selection for resistance is expected. At low doses, certain agents may decelerate aging and age-related diseases. Importantly, deceleration of aging can in turn postpone cancer, which is an age-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Although emerging evidence indicates an important role of the circadian clock in modulating the diurnal oscillation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that Period2 (Per2), a core clock protein, functions as a scaffold protein to tether tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1), Raptor, and mTOR together to specifically suppress the activity of mTORC1 complex. Due to the loss of its inhibition of mTORC1, Per2 deficiency significantly enhances protein synthesis and cell proliferation but reduces autophagy. Furthermore, we find that the glucagon-Creb/Crtc2 signaling cascade induces Per2 expression, which mediates the suppression of mTORC1 in mouse liver during fasting. Our study not only uncovers a novel role of Per2 in regulating the mTORC1 pathway, but also sheds new light on the mechanism of fasting inhibition on mTORC1 in the liver.",

Dysregulated mTOR signaling results in increased cell growth and proliferation. Clinically, TSC patients exhibit great phenotypic variability, but the neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease have the greatest morbidity and mortality. TSC-associated epilepsy occurs in nearly all patients and is often difficult to treat because it is refractory to multiple antiseizure medications. The advent of mTOR inhibitors offers great promise in the treatment of TSC-associated epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental manifestations of the disease; however, the optimal timing of therapeutic intervention is not yet fully understood.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a familial tumor disorder for which there is no effective medical therapy. Disease-causing mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene lead to increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase activity in the conserved mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates nutrient uptake, cell growth, and protein translation. The normal function of TSC1 and TSC2 gene products is to form a complex that reduces mTOR kinase activity. Thus, mTOR kinase inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach. Elevated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression is associated with decreased severity of kidney tumors in TSC patients and mouse models; therefore, IFN-gamma also has therapeutic potential. We studied cohorts of Tsc2+/- mice and a novel mouse model of Tsc2-null tumors in order to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapy for TSC. We found that treatment with either an mTOR kinase inhibitor (CCI-779, a rapamycin analog) or with IFN-gamma reduced the severity of TSC-related disease without significant toxicity. These results constitute definitive preclinical data that justify proceeding with clinical trials using these agents in selected patients with TSC and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Kidney cancer is not a single disease but comprises a number of different types of cancer that occur in the kidney, each caused by a different gene with a different histology and clinical course that responds differently to therapy. Each of the seven known kidney cancer genes, VHL, MET, FLCN, TSC1, TSC2, FH and SDH, is involved in pathways that respond to metabolic stress or nutrient stimulation. The VHL protein is a component of the oxygen and iron sensing pathway that regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) levels in the cell. HGF-MET signaling affects the LKB1-AMPK energy sensing cascade. The FLCN-FNIP1-FNIP2 complex binds AMPK and, therefore, might interact with the cellular energy and nutrient sensing pathways AMPK-TSC1/2-mTOR and PI3K-Akt-mTOR. TSC1-TSC2 is downstream of AMPK and negatively regulates mTOR in response to cellular energy deficit. FH and SDH have a central role in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is coupled to energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in each of these kidney cancer genes result in dysregulation of metabolic pathways involved in oxygen, iron, energy or nutrient sensing, suggesting that kidney cancer is a disease of cell metabolism. Targeting the fundamental metabolic abnormalities in kidney cancer provides a unique opportunity for the development of more-effective forms of therapy for this disease.",

    "issue": "25(1)",
    "pages": "100-11",
    "abstract": "The perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) is a unique cell type coexpressing contractile proteins (mainly α-smooth muscle actin), melanocytic markers, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and estrogen and progesterone receptors. It is constantly present in a group of tumors called PEComas. Renal PEComas include the common angiomyolipoma as well as less common lesions such as microscopic angiomyolipoma, intraglomerular lesions, angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts, epithelioid angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma-like angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the renal sinus. It has been demonstrated that most of these lesions are determined by mutations affecting genes of the tuberous sclerosis complex, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), with eventual deregulation of the RHEB/MTOR/RPS6KB2 pathway, and it has been observed that some PEComas regressed during sirolimus therapy, an MTOR inhibitor. Recently, overexpression of MITF has been related to the expression of the papain-like cysteine protease cathepsin K in osteoclasts where it has inhibited MTOR. The aim of this study is to evaluate cathepsin K immunohistochemically in the entire spectrum of PEComa lesions in the kidney. The study population consisted of 84 renal PEComa lesions, including 5 composed predominantly of fat (lipoma-like angiomyolipoma), 15 almost exclusively composed of spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells (leiomyoma-like angiomyolipoma) and 31 common angiomyolipomas composed of a mixture of fat, spindle and epithelioid smooth muscle cells, and abnormal thick-walled blood vessels, 15 microscopic angiomyolipomas, 5 intraglomerular lesions, 2 oncocytoma-like angiomyolipomas, 8 epithelioid angiomyolipomas, 2 angiomyolipomas with epithelial cysts and 1 example of lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the renal sinus. In all of the renal PEComas, cathepsin K was found to be constantly and strongly expressed and seems to be a more powerful marker than other commonly used markers for their identification, especially to confirm the diagnosis on needle biopsies.",

    "issue": "31(5)",
    "pages": "e12949",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a congenital disorder characterized by cortical malformations and concomitant epilepsy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the mTOR suppressors TSC1 or TSC2. While the underlying molecular changes caused by mTOR activation in TSC have previously been investigated, the drivers of these transcriptional change have not been fully elucidated. A better understanding of the perturbed transcriptional regulation could lead to the identification of novel pathways for therapeutic intervention not only in TSC, but other genetic epilepsies in which mTOR activation plays a key role, such as focal cortical dysplasia 2b (FCD). Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from cortical tubers and a tsc2-/- zebrafish. We identified differential expression of the transcription factors (TFs) SPI1/PU.1, IRF8, GBX2, and IKZF1 of which SPI1/PU.1 and IRF8 targets were enriched among the differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, for SPI1/PU.1 these findings were conserved in TSC zebrafish model. Next, we confirmed overexpression of SPI1/PU.1 on the RNA and protein level in a separate cohort of surgically resected TSC tubers and FCD tissue, in fetal TSC tissue, and a Tsc1GFAP-/- mouse model of TSC. Subsequently, we validated the expression of SPI1/PU.1 in dysmorphic cells with mTOR activation in TSC tubers. In fetal TSC, we detected SPI1/PU.1 expression prenatally and elevated RNA Spi1 expression in Tsc1GFAP-/- mice before the development of seizures. Finally, in vitro, we identified that in astrocytes and neurons SPI1 transcription was driven by H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress, independent of mTOR. We identified SPI1/PU.1 as a novel TF involved in the pro-inflammatory gene expression of malformed cells in TSC and FCD 2b. This transcriptional program is activated in response to oxidative stress and already present prenatally. Importantly, SPI1/PU.1 protein appears to be strictly limited to malformed cells, as we did not find SPI1/PU.1 protein expression in mice nor in our in vitro models.",

    "title": "Carboxy terminal tail of polycystin-1 regulates localization of TSC2 to repress mTOR.",
    "issue": "5(2)",
    "pages": "e9239",
    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a commonly inherited renal disorder caused by defects in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. ADPKD is associated with significant morbidity, and is a major underlying cause of end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Commonly, treatment options are limited to the management of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis, and transplantation when ESRF develops, although several new pharmacotherapies, including rapamycin, have shown early promise in animal and human studies. Evidence implicates polycystin-1 (PC-1), the gene product of the PKD1 gene, in regulation of the mTOR pathway. Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which the intracellular, carboxy-terminal tail of polycystin-1 (CP1) regulates mTOR signaling by altering the subcellular localization of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) tumor suppressor, a gatekeeper for mTOR activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at S939 by AKT causes partitioning of TSC2 away from the membrane, its GAP target Rheb, and its activating partner TSC1 to the cytosol via 14-3-3 protein binding. We found that TSC2 and a C-terminal polycystin-1 peptide (CP1) directly interact and that a membrane-tethered CP1 protects TSC2 from AKT phosphorylation at S939, retaining TSC2 at the membrane to inhibit the mTOR pathway. CP1 decreased binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TSC2 and increased the interaction between TSC2 and its activating partner TSC1. Interestingly, while membrane tethering of CP1 was required to activate TSC2 and repress mTOR, the ability of CP1 to inhibit mTOR signaling did not require primary cilia and was independent of AMPK activation. These data identify a unique mechanism for modulation of TSC2 repression of mTOR signaling via membrane retention of this tumor suppressor, and identify PC-1 as a regulator of this downstream component of the PI3K signaling cascade.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation and hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway define the molecular basis of the hamartoma syndromes, including Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)/lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Loss of the tumor suppressors phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), TSC1, TSC2, and LKB1 results in uncontrolled growth of usually benign tumors in various organs that, however, frequently lead to organ failure. Therefore, organ transplantation is a common therapeutic option in distinct patients with hamartoma syndromes, especially those with TSC/lymphangioleiomyomatosis. mTOR inhibitors are currently used in allogeneic transplantation as immunosuppressants and for the treatment of a growing number of cancers with dysregulated mTOR/phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. This dual targeting provides the unique opportunity for mTOR inhibitors to affect hamartoma syndromes at the molecular level along with potent immunosuppression in transplanted individuals. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of hamartoma syndromes and discuss the recent clinical progress in transplant patients with hamartomas. Combining the identification of novel molecular targets of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mTOR pathway with insights into the clinical effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies sets the stage for a broader translational potential essential for further progress both in the treatment of cancer and for transplantation.",

    "issue": "7(3)",
    "pages": "275-82",
    "abstract": "Until recently, the neuropsychiatric phenotype of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was presumed to be caused by the structural brain abnormalities and/or seizures seen in the disorder. However, advances in the molecular biology of the disorder have shown that TSC is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) overactivation syndrome, and that direct molecular pathways exist between gene mutation and cognitive/neurodevelopmental phenotype. Molecularly-targeted treatments using mTOR inhibitors (such as rapamycin) are showing great promise for the physical and neurological phenotype of TSC. Pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies of the cognitive and neurodevelopmental features of TSC suggest that some of the neuropsychiatric phenotypes might also be reversible, even in adults with the disorder. TSC, fragile X, neurofibromatosis type 1, and disorders associated with phosphatase and tensin homo (PTEN) mutations, all signal through the mTOR signaling pathway, with the TSC1-TSC2 protein complex as a molecular switchboard at its center. Together, these disorders represent as much as 14% of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, we suggest that this signaling pathway is a key to the underlying pathophysiology of a significant subset of individuals with ASD. The study of molecularly targeted treatments in TSC and related disorders, therefore, may be of scientific and clinical value not only to those with TSC, but to a larger population that may have a neuropsychiatric phenotype attributable to mTOR overactivation or dysregulation.",

    "title": "Insulin and amino-acid regulation of mTOR signaling and kinase activity through the Rheb GTPase.",
    "issue": "25(48)",
    "pages": "6361-72",
    "abstract": "Target of Rapamycin (TOR), a giant protein kinase expressed by all eucaryotic cells, controls cell size in response to nutrient signals. In metazoans, cell and organismal growth is controlled by nutrients and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, and the understanding of how these inputs coordinately regulate TOR signaling has advanced greatly in the past 5 years. In single-cell eucaryotes and Caenorhabditis elegans, TOR is a dominant regulator of overall mRNA translation, whereas in higher metazoans, TOR controls the expression of a smaller fraction of mRNAs that is especially important to cell growth. TOR signals through two physically distinct multiprotein complexes, and the control of cell growth is mediated primarily by TOR complex 1 (TORC1), which contains the polypeptides raptor and LST8. Raptor is the substrate binding element of TORC1, and the ability of raptor to properly present substrates, such as the translational regulators 4E-BP and p70 S6 kinase, to the TOR catalytic domain is essential for their TOR-catalysed phosphorylation, and is inhibited by the Rapamycin/FKBP-12 complex. The dominant proximal regulator of TORC1 signaling and kinase activity is the ras-like small GTPase Rheb. Rheb binds directly to the mTOR catalytic domain, and Rheb-GTP enables TORC1 to attain an active configuration. Insulin/IGF enhances Rheb GTP charging through the ability of activated Akt to inhibit the Rheb-GTPase-activating function of the tuberous sclerosis heterodimer (TSC1/TSC2). Conversely, energy depletion reduces Rheb-GTP charging through the ability of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase to phosphorylate TSC2 and stimulate its Rheb-GTPase activating function, as well as by HIFalpha-mediated transcriptional responses that act upstream of the TSC1/2 complex. Amino-acid depletion inhibits TORC1 acting predominantly downstream of the TSC complex, by interfering with the ability of Rheb to bind to mTOR. The components of the insulin/IGF pathway to TORC1 are now well established, whereas the elements mediating the more ancient and functionally dominant input of amino acids remain largely unknown.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins act as a complex that inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated cell growth and proliferation. Loss of either protein leads to overgrowth in many organs, including subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, and cortical tubers in the human brain. Neurological manifestations in TSC include intellectual disability, autism, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy. In a stochastic mouse model of TSC1 brain lesions, complete loss of Tsc1 is achieved in homozygous Tsc1-floxed mice in a subpopulation of neural cells in the brain by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection at birth of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding Cre recombinase. This results in median survival of 38 days and brain pathology, including subependymal lesions and enlargement of neuronal cells. Remarkably, when these mice were injected intravenously on day 21 with an AAV9 vector encoding hamartin, most survived at least up to 429 days in apparently healthy condition with marked reduction in brain pathology. Thus, a single intravenous administration of an AAV vector encoding hamartin restored protein function in enough cells in the brain to extend lifespan in this TSC1 mouse model.",

    "issue": "76(4)",
    "pages": "844-54",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome that is associated with the widespread development of mesenchymal tumor types. Genetically, TSC is said to occur through a classical biallelic inactivation of either TSC genes (TSC1, hamartin or TSC2, tuberin), an event that is implicated in the induction of the mTOR pathway and subsequent tumorigenesis. High Mobility Group A2 (HMGA2), an architectural transcription factor, is known to regulate mesenchymal differentiation and drive mesenchymal tumorigenesis in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of HMGA2 in the pathogenesis of TSC using the TSC2(+/-) mouse model that similarly mirrors human disease and human tumor samples. We show that HMGA2 expression was detected in 100% of human and mouse TSC tumors and that HMGA2 activation was required for TSC mesenchymal tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse models. In contrast to the current dogma, the mTOR pathway was not activated in all TSC2(+/-) tumors and was elevated in only 50% of human mesenchymal tumors. Moreover, except for a subset of kidney tumors, tuberin was expressed in both human and mouse tumors. Therefore, haploinsufficiency of one TSC tumor suppressor gene was required for tumor initiation, but further tumorigenesis did not require the second hit, as previously postulated. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that tissue-specific genetic mechanisms are employed to promote tumor pathogenesis in TSC and identify a novel, critical pathway for potential therapeutic targeting.",

TSC is associated with significant cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral problems, collectively termed TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND), and the cell types responsible for these manifestations are largely unknown. Here we use cell type-specific Tsc1 deletion to test whether dopamine neurons, which modulate cognitive, motivational, and affective behaviors, are involved in TAND. We show that loss of Tsc1 and constitutive activation of mTORC1 in dopamine neurons causes somatodendritic hypertrophy, reduces intrinsic excitability, alters axon terminal structure, and impairs striatal dopamine release. These perturbations lead to a selective deficit in cognitive flexibility, preventable by genetic reduction of the mTOR-binding protein Raptor. Our results establish a critical role for Tsc1-mTORC1 signaling in setting the functional properties of dopamine neurons, and indicate that dopaminergic dysfunction may contribute to cognitive inflexibility in TSC.",

    "pages": "14993-5007",
    "abstract": "Side population (SP) cells are an enriched source of cancer-initiating cells with stemness characteristics, generated by increased ABC transporter activity, which has served as a unique hallmark for multiple myeloma (MM) stem cell studies. Here we isolated and identified MM SP cells via Hoechst 33342 staining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SP cells possess abnormal cell cycle, clonogenicity, and high drug efflux characteristics-all of which are features commonly seen in stem cells. Interestingly, we found that bortezomib, As2O3, and melphalan all affected apoptosis and clonogenicity in SP cells. We followed by characterizing the miRNA signature of MM SP cells and validated the specific miR-451 target tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) gene to reveal that it activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in MM SP cells. Inhibition of miR-451 enhanced anti-myeloma novel agents' effectiveness, through increasing cells apoptosis, decreasing clonogenicity, and reducing MDR1 mRNA expression. Moreover, the novel specific PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitor S14161 displayed its prowess as a potential therapeutic agent by targeting MM SP cells. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms regulating MM SP cells and provide a novel strategy to overcome resistance to existing therapies against myeloma.",

    "title": "Loss of heterozygosity on tuberous sclerosis complex genes in multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia.",
    "issue": "23(9)",
    "pages": "1251-60",
    "abstract": "Multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia is a rare pulmonary manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) that is a tumor suppressor gene disorder characterized by many hamartomas. A purported mechanism of hamartomatous proliferation in TSC is constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway dysregulated by a functional loss of TSC genes. Although multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia develops locally as self-limited, benign lesions, it is morphologically similar to the preinvasive lesion of pneumocytes that characterize atypical adenomatous hyperplasia or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Frequently both conditions include a loss of heterozygosity on TSC. The goal of this study was to determine whether multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia is neoplastic. Loss of heterozygosity on TSC genes and immunohistochemistry for mTOR-related proteins (phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6K, phospho-S6, and phospho-Akt) were analyzed in 42 lesions: 16 multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (7 patients with TSC, 1 TSC not confirmed), 14 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and 12 bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (9 and 12 patients, respectively). The results showed that at least one of two multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia lesions from each patient had loss of heterozygosity on TSC1 or TSC2 (15 or 50%) and were frequently immunopositive for phospho-mTOR (88%), phospho-p70S6K (100%), and phospho-S6 (100%) but not phospho-Akt (14%), an upstream regulatory protein of mTOR. Loss of heterozygosity of TSC was found in the preinvasive lesions of pneumocytes, equal to or less than multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia. In contrast, phospho-Akt was expressed in the preinvasive lesions of pneumocytes more frequently than multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia, but the other mTOR-related proteins were less frequently expressed in the former than in the latter. These outcomes suggest that functional loss of TSCs and consequent hyperphosphorylation of mTOR-related proteins in multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia may cause its benign neoplastic proliferation of pneumocytes.",

    "issue": "20(6)",
    "pages": "1084-91",
    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor tuberin, encoded by the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) gene TSC2, negatively regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays a key role in the control of cell growth and proliferation. In addition to naturally occurring mutations, several kinases including Akt, RSK1, and ERK are known to phosphorylate and inactivate tuberin. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of tuberin inactivation through ubiquitination by Pam, a putative RING finger-containing E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase in mammalian cells. We show that Pam associates with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and tuberin can be ubiquitinated by Pam through its RING finger domain. Tuberin ubiquitination is independent of its phosphorylation by Akt, RSK1, and ERK kinases. Pam is also self-ubiquitinated through its RING finger domain. Moreover, the TSC1 protein hamartin, which forms a heterodimer with tuberin, protects tuberin from ubiquitination by Pam. However, TSC1 fails to protect a disease-associated missense mutant of TSC2 from ubiquitination by Pam. Furthermore, Pam knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) in rat primary neurons elevates the level of tuberin, and subsequently inhibits the mTOR pathway. Our results provide novel evidence that Pam can function as an E3 Ub ligase toward tuberin and regulate mTOR signaling, suggesting that Pam can in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation as well as neuronal function through the TSC/mTOR pathway in mammalian cells.",

    "issue": "172(6)",
    "pages": "1748-56",
    "abstract": "Human cancers often display an avidity for glucose, a feature that is exploited in clinical staging and response monitoring by using (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. Determinants of FDG accumulation include tumor blood flow, glucose transport, and glycolytic rate, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1 pathway has been implicated in this process via the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha-dependent expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and glycolytic enzymes. Thus, we predicted that tumors with elevated mTORC1 activity would be accompanied by high FDG uptake. We tested this hypothesis in eight renal angiomyolipomas in which the loss of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1/2 function gave rise to constitutive mTORC1 activation. Surprisingly, these tumors displayed low FDG uptake on positron emission tomography. Exploring the underlying mechanisms in vitro revealed that Tsc2 regulates the membrane localization of the glucose transporter proteins (Glut)1, Glut2, and Glut4, and, therefore, glucose uptake. Down-regulation of cytoplasmic linker protein 170, an mTOR effector, rescued Glut4 trafficking in Tsc2(-/-) cells, whereas up-regulation of Akt activity in these cells was insufficient to redistribute Glut4 to the plasma membrane. The effect of mTORC1 on glucose uptake was confirmed using a liver-specific Tsc1- deletion mouse model in which FDG uptake was reduced in the livers of mutant mice compared with wild-type controls. Together, these data show that mTORC1 activity is insufficient for increased glycolysis in tumors and that constitutive mTOR activity negatively regulates glucose transporter trafficking.",

In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2, which is not well understood, participates in cell survival and the regulation of actin and cytokeratin organization. In addition, mTORC1 has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, metabolic diseases, neurological disease, genetic diseases and longevity/aging. One of the diseases resulting from dysfunction of mTORC1 is tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which reflects all the symptoms that arise in response to mTORC1 dysfunction. TSC is a multiple hamartomas syndrome with epilepsy, autism, mental retardation and hypopigmented macules that are caused by the constitutive activation of mTORC1 resulting from genetic mutation of TSC1 or TSC2. Inhibitors of mTORC1, such as rapamycin, effectively suppress the symptoms of TSC. This article summarizes the current knowledge on mTOR and the efficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of TSC.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) proteins are a family of transcription factors (NFATc1-c4) involved in the regulation of cell differentiation. We identified REDD1, a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2 complex), as a new molecular target of NFATc3. We show that treatment with a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionophore A23187 (Io), which induces NFAT activation, increased REDD1 mRNA and protein expression and inhibited mTOR signaling; pretreatment with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), an antagonist of NFAT signaling, decreased REDD1 induction and mTOR inhibition. Knockdown of NFATc3, not NFATc1, NFATc2, or NFATc4, attenuated PMA/Io-induced REDD1 expression. Treatment with PMA/Io increased REDD1 promoter activity and increased NFATc3 binding to the REDD1 promoter. Overexpression of NFATc3 increased REDD1 mRNA and protein expression and increased PMA/Io-mediated REDD1 promoter activity. Treatment with PMA/Io increased expression of the goblet cell differentiation marker MUC2; these changes were attenuated by pretreatment with CsA or knockdown of REDD1 or NFATc3. Overexpression of NFATc3 increased, while knockdown of TSC2 decreased, MUC2 expression. We provide evidence showing NFATc3 inhibits mTOR via induction of REDD1. Our results suggest a role for the NFATc3/REDD1/TSC2 axis in the regulation of intestinal cell differentiation.",

    "issue": "19(10)",
    "pages": "913-925",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in benign tumors in various organs. It is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes causing hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The majority of patients with TSC develop epilepsy, and approximately two-thirds become refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Recently, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved as adjunctive therapy for TSC-associated partial seizures. Areas covered: This article covers different characteristics of everolimus, including major clinical trials leading to its approval in TSC-associated partial seizures, safety concerns, drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and an overview of potential competitors and other agents used to treat TSC-associated seizures. Expert opinion: Unlike many other therapies for treating TSC-associated seizures, everolimus addresses the underlying pathophysiology of TSC, and since it has also been shown to improve other TSC manifestations such as subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas, everolimus provides a potential multisystemic therapy for TSC. An important avenue for future research is exploring the possible use of everolimus as a preventative treatment for seizures as there is the potential to prevent negative developmental outcomes associated with TSC.",

    "title": "Phosphorylation of TSC2 by PKC-δ reveals a novel signaling pathway that couples protein synthesis to mTORC1 activity.",
    "issue": "456(1-2)",
    "pages": "123-134",
    "abstract": "Downstream of insulin-like growth factor receptor, the TSC1/2/ TCB1D7 (tuberous sclerosis complex) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathways are implicated in many human diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Targeting this pathway is currently an important approach for palliating or eradicating cancer. Downstream of mTOR, translational machinery targeting holds great promise for anticancer drug development. Therefore, we investigated whether the protein synthesis machinery that is regulated by mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) signaling can in turn regulate mTORC1 activity. We found that inhibition of protein synthesis results in rapid activation of mTORC1 signaling, thereby uncovering a feedback loop between mTOR and the translation machinery. This mTORC1 activation requires tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) but is independent of AKT. In addition, by using a PKC-δ (protein kinase c delta)-specific inhibitor and PKC-δ siRNA knockdown, we found that PKC-δ kinase activity is required for mTORC1 activation in response to translation inhibitors. Furthermore, translation inhibition activates PKC-δ. Subsequently, we investigated whether PKC-δ can phosphorylate and inactivate TSC1/2, leading to mTORC1 activation. In vitro kinase assays showed direct phosphorylation of TSC2 (S932 and S939) by PKC-δ, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In vivo kinase analysis further indicated that both S932 and S939 are phosphorylated in response to translation inhibitors. Finally, phosphorylation defective TSC2 mutants (S932A and S939A single mutants and a S932A/S939A double mutant) failed to upregulate mTORC1 activity in the presence of translation inhibitors, suggesting that activation of mTORC1 by translation inhibitors is mediated by PKC-δ phosphorylation of TSC2 at S932/S939, which inactivates TSC.",

    "issue": "88(4)",
    "pages": "711-21",
    "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients, but the pathogenesis remains partially unknown and effective therapeutic targets should be urgently explored. Here we pursued the therapeutic role of rapamycin in CRF-related VC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal was activated in the aortic wall of CRF rats. As expected, oral rapamycin administration significantly reduced VC by inhibiting mTOR in rats with CRF. Further in vitro results showed that activation of mTOR by both pharmacological agent and genetic method promoted, while inhibition of mTOR reduced, inorganic phosphate-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification and chondrogenic/osteogenic gene expression, which were independent of autophagy and apoptosis. Interestingly, the expression of Klotho, an antiaging gene that suppresses VC, was reduced in calcified vasculature, whereas rapamycin reversed membrane and secreted Klotho decline through mTOR inhibition. When mTOR signaling was enhanced by either mTOR overexpression or deletion of tuberous sclerosis 1, Klotho mRNA was further decreased in phosphate-treated VSMCs, suggesting a vital association between mTOR signaling and Klotho expression. More importantly, rapamycin failed to reduce VC in the absence of Klotho by using either siRNA knockdown of Klotho or Klotho knockout mice. Thus, Klotho has a critical role in mediating the observed decrease in calcification by rapamycin in vitro and in vivo.",

    "pages": "1663-1673",
    "abstract": "The functional role of colonic epithelium in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism by which colonic epithelia recruit T helper-17 (Th17) cells during the onset of UC. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was hyper-activated in colonic epithelia of UC mice. While colonic epithelial TSC1 (mTORC1 negative regulator) disruption induced constitutive mTORC1 activation in the colon epithelia and aggravated UC, RPTOR (essential mTORC1 component) depletion inactivated mTORC1 and ameliorated UC. TSC1 deficiency enhanced, whereas RPTOR ablation reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-23, as well as Th17 infiltration in the colon. Importantly, inhibition of COX-2 reversed the elevation in the expression of these proinflammatory mediators induced by TSC1 deficiency, and subsequently reduced the symptoms and pathological characteristics of UC in mouse models. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activates COX-2 transcription via phosphorylating STAT3 and enhancing it's binding to the COX-2 promoter. Consistently, enhanced mTORC1 activity and COX2 expression, as well as strong positive correlation between each other, were observed in colonic epithelial tissues of UC patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates an essential role of epithelial mTORC1 in UC pathogenesis and establishes a novel link between colonic epithelium, Th17 responses, and UC development.",

Here, using a new inducible deletion system, we show that deletion of Tsc1 in mouse primary mammary tumor cells, either before or after their transplantation, significantly increased their growth in vivo. The increase in tumor growth was completely rescued by rapamycin treatment, suggesting a major contribution from mTORC1 hyperactivation. Interestingly, glucose starvation-induced autophagy, but not amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, was increased significantly in Tsc1-null tumor cells. Further analysis of these cells also showed an increased Akt activation but no significant changes in Erk signaling. Together, these results provide insights into the mechanism by which hyperactivation of mTORC1 promotes breast cancer progression through increasing autophagy and Akt activation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures, particularly infantile spasms, are often seen in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) soon after birth. It is feared that there are long-term developmental and cognitive consequences from ongoing, frequent epilepsy. In addition, the hallmark brain pathology of TSC, cortical tubers and giant cells are fully developed at late gestational ages. These observations have led us to examine the benefit of prenatal rapamycin in a new fetal brain model of TSC. In this Tsc1(cc) Nes-cre(+) mouse model, recombination and loss of Tsc1 in neural progenitor cells leads to brain enlargement, hyperactivation of mTOR, and neonatal death on P0 due to reduced pup-maternal interaction. A single dose of prenatal rapamycin given to pregnant dams (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) rescued the lethality of mutant mice. This one dose of prenatal rapamycin treatment reduced hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway in the mutant brain without causing apparent pregnancy loss. Continued postnatal rapamycin beginning at day 8 extended the survival of these mice to a median of 12 days with complete suppression of hyperactive mTOR. However, the rapamycin-treated mutants developed enlarged brains with an increased number of brain cells, displaying marked runting and developmental delay. These observations demonstrate the therapeutic benefit and limitations of prenatal rapamycin in a prenatal-onset brain model of TSC. Our data also suggest the possibility and limitations of this approach for TSC infants and mothers.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes, TSC1 and TSC2, encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively, and are putative tumor suppressor genes that were originally identified due to their involvement in the inherited autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis. It has been elucidated that the two proteins form an intracellular heterodimer participating in signaling pathway of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Recent studies showed that mTOR pathway was frequently activated in blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient and associated with proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance of these cells. These phenomena led us to hypothesize that TSC gene might be involved in acute leukemia (AL). In this study, we investigated the TSC1 and TSC2 mRNA expression in 104 newly diagnosed AL patients and 29 healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and explored the potential mechanisms of the aberrant expression through methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results showed that the expression of TSC2 was downregulated in AL patients and the TSC2 promoter was hypermethylated which might be an important mechanism for the downregulation of TSC2 expression.",

    "issue": "20(3)",
    "pages": "244-255",
    "abstract": "Plk2 is a target of p53. Our previous studies demonstrated that with wild-type p53, Plk2 impacts mTOR signaling in the same manner as TSC1, and Plk2-deficient tumors grew larger than control. Other investigators have demonstrated that Plk2 phosphorylates mutant p53 in a positive feedback loop. We investigated Plk2's tumor suppressor functions in relationship to mTOR signaling. Archival specimens from 12 colorectal adenocarcinomas were stained for markers including Plk2, phosphorylated mTOR (serine 2448) and ribosomal S6 (Serine 235/236). We show that Plk2 is expressed in normal colon, with a punctate staining pattern in supranuclear cytoplasm. In colorectal adenocarcinoma, Plk2 demonstrates complete or partial loss of expression. Strong expression of phosphorylated mTOR is observed in the invasive front. Phosphorylated S6 expression partially correlates with phosphorylated mTOR expression but appears more diffuse in some cases. p53 and Ki67 expression is diffuse, in the subset of cases examined. In order to determine whether Plk2 is lost prior to the development of invasive cancer, 8 colon polyps from 6 patients were evaluated for Plk2 expression. All polyps are positive for Plk2. A Cancer Genome Atlas search identified Plk2 mutations to be infrequent in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Neither Plk2 methylation (in the gene body) nor copy number variations correlated with changes in mRNA expression levels. Loss of Plk2 expression along with accentuated expression of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated S6 at the invasive front in some colorectal carcinomas is consistent with previous findings that an interaction between Plk2 and TSC1 / mTOR signaling molecules plays a role in tumor suppression. Plk2 protein expression is lost at the same stage in colorectal carcinogenesis as p53. The p53 dependence of Plk2 loss and tumor suppressor function in relationship to mTOR signaling may have therapeutic implications.",

    "issue": "18(2)",
    "pages": "845-858",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominant autosomal genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, which lead to constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1) with its decoupling from regulatory inputs. Because mTORC1 integrates an array of molecular signals controlling protein synthesis and energy metabolism, its unrestrained activation inflates cell growth and division, resulting in the development of benign tumors in the brain and other organs. In humans, brain malformations typically manifest through a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, among which mental retardation, intellectual disabilities with signs of autism, and refractory seizures, which are the most prominent. TSC in the rat brain presents the first-rate approximation of cellular and molecular pathology of the human brain, showing many instructive characteristics. Nevertheless, the developmental profile and distribution of lesions in the rat brain, with neurophysiological and behavioral manifestation, deviate considerably from humans, raising numerous research and translational questions. In this study, we revisit brain TSC in human and Eker rats to relate their histopathological, electrophysiological, and neurobehavioral characteristics. We discuss shared and distinct aspects of the pathology and consider factors contributing to phenotypic discrepancies. Given the shared genetic cause and molecular pathology, phenotypic deviations suggest an incomplete understanding of the disease. Narrowing the knowledge gap in the future should not only improve the characterization of the TSC rat model but also explain considerable variability in the clinical manifestation of the disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Tendons transmit contractile forces between musculoskeletal tissues. Whereas the biomechanical properties of tendons have been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms regulating postnatal tendon development are not well understood. Here we examine the role of mTORC1 signaling in postnatal tendon development using mouse genetic approaches. Loss of mTORC1 signaling by removal of Raptor in tendons caused severe tendon defects postnatally, including decreased tendon thickness, indicating that mTORC1 is necessary for postnatal tendon development. By contrast, activation of mTORC1 signaling in tendons increased tendon cell numbers and proliferation. In addition, Tsc1 conditional knockout mice presented severely disorganized collagen fibers and neovascularization in the tendon midsubstance. Interestingly, collagen fibril diameter was significantly reduced in both Raptor and Tsc1 conditional knockout mice, albeit with variations in severity. We performed RNA-seq analysis using Achilles tendons to investigate the molecular changes underlying these tendon phenotypes. Raptor conditional knockout mice showed decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) structure-related gene expression, whereas Tsc1 conditional knockout mice exhibited changes in genes regulating TGF-β/BMP/FGF signaling, as well as in genes controlling ECM structure and disassembly. Collectively, our studies suggest that maintaining physiological levels of mTORC1 signaling is essential for postnatal tendon development and maturation.",

    "abstract": "Age-related declines in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function may contribute to anemia, poor response to vaccination, and tumorigenesis. Here, we show that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity is increased in HSCs from old mice compared to those from young mice. mTOR activation through conditional deletion of Tsc1 in the HSCs of young mice mimicked the phenotype of HSCs from aged mice in various ways. These included increased abundance of the messenger RNA encoding the CDK inhibitors p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf), and p21(Cip1); a relative decrease in lymphopoiesis; and impaired capacity to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. In old mice, rapamycin increased life span, restored the self-renewal and hematopoiesis of HSCs, and enabled effective vaccination against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. Together, our data implicate mTOR signaling in HSC aging and show the potential of mTOR inhibitors for restoring hematopoiesis in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed on the basis of three behavioral features namely deficits in social communication, absence or delay in language, and stereotypy. The susceptibility genes to ASD remain largely unknown, but two major pathways are emerging. Mutations in TSC1/TSC2, NF1, or PTEN activate the mTOR/PI3K pathway and lead to syndromic ASD with tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, or macrocephaly. Mutations in NLGN3/4, SHANK3, or NRXN1 alter synaptic function and lead to mental retardation, typical autism, or Asperger syndrome. The mTOR/PI3K pathway is associated with abnormal cellular/synaptic growth rate, whereas the NRXN-NLGN-SHANK pathway is associated with synaptogenesis and imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory currents. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that abnormal synaptic homeostasis represent a risk factor to ASD.",

    "title": "Fenofibrate Suppresses Oral Tumorigenesis via Reprogramming Metabolic Processes: Potential Drug Repurposing for Oral Cancer.",
    "issue": "12(7)",
    "pages": "786-98",
    "abstract": "One anticancer strategy suggests targeting mitochondrial metabolism to trigger cell death through slowing down energy production from the Warburg effect. Fenofibrate is a clinical lipid-lowering agent and an effective anticancer drug. In the present study, we demonstrate that fenofibrate provided novel mechanisms for delaying oral tumor development via the reprogramming of metabolic processes. Fenofibrate induced cytotoxicity by decreasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) that was accompanied with increasing extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and reducing ATP content. Moreover, fenofibrate caused changes in the protein expressions of hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which are associated with the Warburg effect. In addition, fenofibrate reprogrammed the metabolic pathway by interrupting the binding of HK II to VDAC. In an oral cancer mouse model, fenofibrate exhibited both preventive and therapeutic efficacy on oral tumorigenesis. Fenofibrate administration suppressed the incidence rate of tongue lesions, reduced the tumor sizes, decreased the tumor multiplicity, and decreased the immunoreactivities of VDAC and mTOR. The molecular mechanisms involved in fenofibrate's ability to delay tumor development included the down-regulation of mTOR activity via TSC1/2-dependent signaling through activation of AMPK and inactivation of Akt, or via a TSC1/2-independent pathway through direct suppression of raptor. Our findings provide a molecular rationale whereby fenofibrate exerts anticancer and additional beneficial effects for the treatment of oral cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis genes and MTOR are increasingly being found to have important roles in novel subtypes of renal cancer, particularly emerging entities eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and high-grade oncocytic renal tumor (HOT)/RCC with eosinophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm. We report a unique renal neoplasm in a 66-year-old woman that initially mimicked MITF family translocation RCC due to mixed clear and eosinophilic cells, extensive stromal hyalinization, and psammoma bodies, yet which was negative for TFE3 and TFEB fluorescence in situ hybridization and a next generation sequencing (NGS) gene fusion assay. Cytoplasmic stippling triggered consideration of TSC-associated neoplasms, and a targeted NGS assay revealed a variant in exon 21 of TSC1 resulting in c.2626G>T p.(Glu876*) truncating mutation. This report adds to the morphologic spectrum of TSC-related renal neoplasms, including prominent stromal hyalinization as a potentially deceptive pattern. Due to the overlap in cytoplasmic stippling between eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC and HOT/RCC with eosinophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm, it is debatable which category this example would best fit. Further understanding of these entities and other renal neoplasms with alterations in the TSC genes will elucidate whether they should be considered a family of tumors.",

    "pages": "1195-205",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. TSC has high frequency of osseous manifestations such as sclerotic lesions in the craniofacial region. However, an animal model that replicates TSC craniofacial bone lesions has not yet been described. The roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in bone are unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model of TSC with a deletion of Tsc1 in neural crest-derived (NCD) cells that recapitulated the sclerotic craniofacial bone lesions in TSC. Analysis of this mouse model demonstrated that TSC1 deletion led to enhanced mTORC1 signaling in NCD bones and the increase in bone formation is responsible for the aberrantly increased bone mass. Lineage mapping revealed that TSC1 deficient NCD cells overpopulated the NCD bones. Mechanistically, hyperproliferation of osteoprogenitors at an early postnatal stage accounts for the increased osteoblast pool. Intriguingly, early postnatal treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, can completely rescue the aberrant bone mass, but late treatment cannot. Our data suggest that enhanced mTOR signaling in NCD cells can increase bone mass through enlargement of the osteoprogenitor pool, which likely explains the sclerotic bone lesion observed in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key kinase complex that regulates cell size and growth, is observed with inactivating mutations of either of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, Tsc1 and Tsc2. Tsc1 and Tsc2 are highly expressed in cardiovascular tissue but their functional role there is unknown. We generated a tissue-specific knock-out of Tsc1, using a conditional allele of Tsc1 and a cre recombinase allele regulated by the smooth muscle protein-22 (SM22) promoter (Tsc1c/cSM22cre+/-) to constitutively activate mTOR in cardiovascular tissue. Significant gene recombination (∼80%) occurred in the heart by embryonic day (E) 15, and reduction in Tsc1 expression with increased levels of phosphorylated S6 kinase (S6K) and S6 was observed, consistent with constitutive activation of mTORC1. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident by E15 with post-natal progression to heart weights of 142 ± 24 mg in Tsc1c/cSM22cre+/- mice versus 65 ± 14 mg in controls (P < 0.01). Median survival of Tsc1c/cSM22cre+/- mice was 24 days, with none surviving beyond 6 weeks. Pathologic and echocardiographic analysis revealed severe biventricular hypertrophy without evidence of fibrosis or myocyte disarray, and significant reduction in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P < 0.001) and fractional index (P < 0.001). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin resulted in prolonged survival of Tsc1c/cSM22cre+/- mice, with regression of ventricular hypertrophy. These data support a critical role for the Tsc1/Tsc2-mTORC1-S6K axis in the normal development of cardiovascular tissue and also suggest possible therapeutic potential of rapamycin in cardiac disorders where pathologic mTORC1 activation occurs.",

    "issue": "7(1)",
    "pages": "e2050",
    "abstract": "Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is indispensable to maintain the pluripotent state of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but the mechanisms underlying the role of LIF/STAT3 pathway are yet poorly understood. Here we first showed that the LIF/STAT3-regulated signaling pathway contributes to the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ESCs by suppressing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is necessary for early differentiation. When LIF is withdrawn from culture medium, the mTOR activity rapidly increases as detected by phosphorylation of its targets - ribosomal protein S6 and translation factor 4EBP1. In turn, suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 by a specific small molecule WP1066 also activates phosphorylation of the mTOR target S6 ribosomal protein. LIF removal strongly activates ERK activity indicating that ERK can be involved in either direct phosphorylation of mTOR or phosphorylation of an upstream negative regulator of mTOR - TSC1/TSC2 proteins. According to western blotting data, LIF withdrawal leads to phosphorylation of TSC2 protein thereby relieving its negative effect on mTOR activity. mTOR activation is accompanied by a decrease of pluripotent gene expression Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2 and by an augmentation of fgf5 gene expression - a marker of post-implantation epiblast. Together, these data indicate that LIF-depleted mouse ESCs undergo a transition from the LIF/STAT3-supported pluripotent state to the FGFR/ERK-committed primed-like state with expression of early differentiation markers mediated through activation of mTOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a multisystem disease affecting almost exclusively women, is characterized by cystic lung destruction and presents with dyspnea, recurrent pneumothoraxes, chylous effusions, lymphangioleiomyomas, and angiomyolipomas. It is caused by the proliferation of a cancer-like LAM cell that possesses a mutation in either the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 or TSC2 genes. This article reviews current therapies and new potential treatments that are currently undergoing investigation. The major development in the treatment of LAM is the discovery of two mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, sirolimus and everolimus, as effective drugs. However, inhibition of mTOR increases autophagy, which may lead to enhanced LAM cell survival. Use of autophagy inhibitors, for example, hydroxychloroquine, in combination with sirolimus is now the subject of an ongoing drug trial (SAIL trial). Another consequence of mTOR inhibition by sirolimus is an increase in Rho activity, resulting in reduced programmed cell death. From these data, the concept evolved that a combination of sirolimus with disruption of Rho activity with statins (e.g. simvastatin) may increase TSC-null cell death and reduce LAM cell survival. A combined trial of sirolimus with simvastatin is under investigation (SOS trial). Since LAM occurs primarily in women and TSC-null cell survival and tumor growth is promoted by estrogens, the inhibition of aromatase to block estrogen synthesis is currently undergoing study (TRAIL trial). Other targets, for example, estrogen receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor-D signaling pathway, and Src kinase, are also being studied in experimental model systems. As in the case of cancer, combination therapy may become the treatment of choice for LAM.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that occurs upon mutation of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode the protein products hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Here, we show that hamartin and tuberin function together to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). First, coexpression of hamartin and tuberin repressed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E; importantly, a mutant of TSC2 derived from TSC patients was defective in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Second, the activity of S6K1 was repressed by coexpression of hamartin and tuberin, but the activity of rapamycin-resistant mutants of S6K1 were not affected, implicating mTOR in the TSC-mediated inhibitory effect on S6K1. Third, hamartin and tuberin blocked the ability of amino acids to activate S6K1 within nutrient-deprived cells, a process that is dependent on mTOR. These findings strongly implicate the tuberin-hamartin tumor suppressor complex as an inhibitor of mTOR and suggest that the formation of tumors within TSC patients may result from aberrantly high levels of mTOR-mediated signaling to downstream targets.",

By using drs-knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we showed that drs is involved in the host defense against viral infection. In drs-KO MEFs infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, the viral replication and protein synthesis were markedly enhanced without the upregulation of the cellular protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of S6K, S6, 4EBP1 and TSC2 proteins was closely correlated with the enhanced viral replication in drs-KO MEFs. Drs protein could associate with stress-inducible GADD34 to form a complex with TSC1/2, which suppresses mTOR activity.

    "abstract": "Obesity-related hormones and cytokines alter PI3 K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation in breast tumors contributing to poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and decreased responsiveness to tamoxifen and trastuzumab. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes in the PI3 K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway may act as genetic modifiers of breast cancer DFS. We analyzed the association of 106 tagging SNPs in 13 genes (ADIPOQ, IGF1, INS, IRS1, LEP, LEPR, LEPROT, PIK3CA, PIK3R5, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, and AKT1) in the P13K-AKT-mTOR pathway with DFS in a sample of 1,019 women with stage I-II breast cancer. SNPs significantly associated with DFS in any genetic model (additive, dominant, or recessive) after correcting for false discovery rate (FDR = 0.10) were included in Cox proportional hazards multivariable analyses. After adjusting for race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and treatment, rs1063539 in ADIPOQ, rs11585329 in LEPR, and rs2519757 in TSC1 were associated with improved DFS, and rs1520220 in IGF1 and rs2677760 in PIK3CA were associated with worse DFS. The associations were not significantly modified by the type of systemic treatment received or body mass index. The SNPs were not associated with tumor characteristics such as tumor size, lymph node status, nuclear grade, or hormone receptor status. In this study, germline SNPs in the PI3 K-AKT-mTOR pathway were associated with breast cancer DFS and may be potential prognostic markers. Future studies are needed to replicate our results and to evaluate the relationship between these polymorphisms and activation of the PI3 K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast tumors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a common neurological autosomal-dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC starts in early childhood and is characterized by cerebral hamartomas (benign tumours), severe epilepsy and cognitive deficits such as mental retardation and autism. The hamartomas are characterized by loss of the remaining wild-type TSC allele, and clinical data implicate cerebral hamartomas in the generation of epileptic seizures, which may play a significant role in the development of mental retardation. The TSC2 mutation predicts alterations in mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) and, together with the TSC1 mutation, in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathways. Both pathways are involved in neuronal plasticity. We therefore hypothesized that the heterozygous mutation itself, besides cerebral hamartomas, contributes to the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits and possibly also epilepsy. Here, we show that young adult TSC2+/- rats, which are virtually free of cerebral hamartomas, exhibit enhanced episodic-like memory and enhanced responses to chemically-induced kindling. The activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus results in stronger induction of phospho-p42-MAPK in TSC2+/- rats than in wild-type animals. Thus, the cognitive phenotype and, possibly, epilepsy in TSC patients may result not only from the focal hamartomatous lesions but also, from altered neuronal plasticity in the heterozygous tissue.",

    "issue": "131(Pt B)",
    "pages": "107713",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disease due to the mutation in one of the two genes TSC1 and TSC2, affecting several organs and systems and carrying a significant risk of early onset and refractory seizures. The pathogenesis of this complex disorder is now well known, with most of TSC-related manifestations being a consequence of the overactivation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) complex. The discovery of this underlying mechanism paved the way for the use of a class of drugs called mTOR inhibitors including rapamycin and everolimus and specifically targeting this pathway. Rapamycin has been widely used in different animal models of TSC-related epilepsy and proved to be able not only to suppress seizures but also to prevent the development of epilepsy, thus demonstrating an antiepileptogenic potential. In some models, it also showed some benefit on neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with TSC. Everolimus has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medical Agency for the treatment of refractory seizures associated with TSC starting from the age of 2 years. It demonstrated a clear benefit when compared to placebo on reducing the frequency of different seizure types and exerting a higher effect in younger children. In conclusion, mTOR cascade can be a potentially major cause of TSC-associated epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disability, and additional research should investigate if early suppression of abnormal mTOR signal with mTOR inhibitors before seizure onset can be a more efficient approach and an effective antiepileptogenic and disease-modifying strategy in infants with TSC.",

The localization, extent and histopathological features of FCDs are considerably variable. Somatic mosaic mutations of genes that encode proteins in the PI3K-AKTmTOR pathway, which also includes the tuberous sclerosis associated genes TSC1 and TSC2, have been implicated in FCD type II in a substantial subset of patients. Surgery is the principal therapeutic option for FCD-related epilepsy.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare systemic disease of young women arising from mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, TSC1 or TSC2. This disrupts the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, affecting cellular proliferation and growth. mTOR inhibitors are a promising novel therapy in LAM. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus is reported to produce resolution of lymphatic abnormalities in LAM, but the efficiacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has not been assessed. We aimed to examine the efficacy of everolimus on lymphatic abnormalities in LAM.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nOpen-label treatment of five patients with sporadic LAM (sLAM) and abdominopelvic and lung involvement at the outpatient LAM clinic of a tertiary city teaching hospital. Clinical data were collected during treatment of the women and included regular clinical reviews, everolimus levels, lung function and computed tomography assessment before and after 6 months of everolimus treatment.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSymptoms and level of resolution of lymphangioleiomyomas.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll five women experienced significant shrinkage or complete resolution of the lymphangioleiomyomas during treatment. In one woman, cessation of everolimus resulted in recurrence of symptoms. Adverse events were compatible with the known side-effect profile of everolimus, but overall the drug was well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first report to suggest that everolimus has efficacy in the treatment of lymphangioleiomyoma and chylous ascites in sLAM.",

    "issue": "73(6)",
    "pages": "1446-1459",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nAbnormal activation of mTORC1 signaling occurs at high frequency in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying causes of this aberrant activation remain elusive. In this study, we identified ventricular zone expressed pleckstrin homology domain-containing 1 (VEPH1) as a novel tumor suppressor that acts via the mTORC1 axis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (92 pairs), western blot (30 pairs), and immunostaining (225 cases) assays in HCC tissue samples to evaluate VEPH1 expression. We explored the functional effects of VEPH1 on tumor growth and metastasis. Molecular and biochemical strategies were used to gain insight into mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of VEPH1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVEPH1 is frequently silenced in HCC tissues, primarily resulting from let-7d upregulation. Decreased VEPH1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor phenotypes in patients with HCC. VEPH1 mediates its tumor-suppressing activity through regulation of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The VEPH1 fragments 580-625aa and 447-579 aa bind directly to TSC1 (719-1,164aa) and TSC2 (1-420 aa), respectively, enhancing TSC1/TCS2 binding and promoting translocation of TSC2 to the membrane, which leads to increased TSC2 Ser1387 phosphorylation. Subsequently, Rheb is inactivated by the GTPase activity of TSC2, inhibiting mTORC1 signaling and contributing to changes in HCC carcinogenesis and metastasis. Rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, can inhibit the pro-tumorigenic effect of VEPH1 knockdown. Loss of VEPH1 correlates with decreased TSC2 Ser1387 phosphorylation and increased mTOR activity in HCC specimens.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe loss of VEPH1 leads to aberrantly activated mTORC1 signaling in HCC; rapamycin (or rapalogs) may serve as an effective treatment option for patients with HCC and dampened VEPH1 expression.\n\n\nLAY SUMMARY\nAbnormally activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is associated with poor tumor differentiation, early tumor recurrence and worse overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we identify low VEPH1 expression as a potential cause of abnormally activated mTOR signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. mTOR inhibitors could thus be an effective treatment option for patients with HCC and low VEPH1 expression.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 genes, resulting in constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and impairment of the cell cycle. As a consequence, hamartomatous tumors of multiple organs may develop, but generally skin, brain, kidneys, and lungs are involved. mTOR inhibitors (mTOR-I, rapamycin/everolimus) may correct underlying defects in TSC. Previous data prove benefits and safety of mTOR-I on a wide spectrum of disease manifestations and effectiveness of rapamycin in TSC patients after kidney transplantation (KT).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe report the first case of a patient with TSC receiving everolimus initiated in immunosuppressive treatment at the time of KT. In April 2012, the 34-year-old female TSC patient, after bilateral nephrectomy due to polycystic kidneys and skin lesions related to TSC, was transplanted with a renal graft from a deceased donor (PRA, 0%; MM A/B/DR,1/2/0). Initial immunosuppressive treatment consisted of basiliximab, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, and everolimus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe early postoperative period was complicated by delayed graft function. Creatinine level at discharge was 1.39 mg/dL, with stable graft function in subsequent months. Nine months after KT, inflammatory infiltration of the nephrectomy site (performed in 2011) with persistent effusion was observed. After 2 months of unsuccessful conservative treatment, the patient was converted from everolimus to mycophenolate mofetil with healing of local state. During 11 months of everolimus treatment, no improvement of skin presentation of TSC was noticed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nmTOR-I appear to be a treatment of choice in transplanted patients with TSC, although some complications precluding continuous mTOR-I therapy allowing its potential benefits, may appear.",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of the world's population suffers from sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) with available present therapies limited to symptomatic care that does not alter disease progression. Over the next decade, advancing age of the global population will dramatically increase the incidence of AD and severely impact health care resources, necessitating novel, safe, and efficacious strategies for AD. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its protein complexes mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) offer exciting and unique avenues of intervention for AD through the oversight of programmed cell death pathways of apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. mTOR modulates multi-faceted signal transduction pathways that involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K), protein kinase B (Akt), hamartin (tuberous sclerosis 1)/ tuberin (tuberous sclerosis 2) (TSC1/TSC2) complex, proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and can interface with the neuroprotective pathways of growth factors, sirtuins, wingless, forkhead transcription factors, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β. With the ability of mTOR to broadly impact cellular function, clinical strategies for AD that implement mTOR must achieve parallel objectives of protecting neuronal, vascular, and immune cell survival in conjunction with preserving networks that determine memory and cognitive function.",

Many organ systems can be affected, such as brain, skin, eye, heart, bone, kidney, or lung. Sclerotic bone lesions have been reported as frequent findings in TSC although they are not considered diagnostic criteria. The objective of this study is to characterize sclerotic bone lesions detected by chest CT in a large cohort of adult TSC patients and to correlate with genotype. Chest CT scans of 92 adult patients with a definite clinical diagnosis of TSC were reviewed. Sclerotic bone lesions were found in 82 cases (89%) and affected mainly the posterior vertebral elements. Patients without bone lesions had negative mutational studies of TSC1/TSC2 in 86%. Awareness of these lesions in TSC is important to avoid misdiagnosis with osteoblastic metastases.",

    "abstract": "The intermolt crustacean Y-organ (YO) maintains a basal state mediated by pulsatile release of molt inhibiting hormone (MIH), a neuropeptide produced in the eyestalk ganglia, inhibiting YO ecdysteroidogenesis. Reduction of MIH results in YO activation and the animal enters premolt. In the crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, molting was induced by eyestalk ablation (ESA). ESA animals were injected with either rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, or DMSO vehicle at Day 0. YOs were harvested at 1, 3, and 7 days post-ESA and processed for high throughput RNA sequencing. ESA-induced increases in mRNA levels of mTOR signaling genes (e.g., mTOR, Rheb, TSC1/2, Raptor, Akt, and S6 kinase) declined following rapamycin treatment. In concert with mTOR inhibition, mRNA levels of ecdysteroid biosynthesis genes (e.g., Nvd, Spo, Sad, Dib, and Phm) were decreased and accompanied by a decrease in hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. By contrast, rapamycin increased the mRNA level of FKBP12, the rapamycin-binding protein, as well as the mRNA levels of genes associated with Wnt and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways. Many MIH and transforming growth factor-β signaling genes were down regulated in ESA animals. These results indicate that mTOR activity either directly or indirectly controls transcription of genes that drive activation of the YO.",

    "title": "Regulation of protein synthesis by insulin.",
    "issue": "34(Pt 2)",
    "pages": "213-6",
    "abstract": "Insulin rapidly activates protein synthesis by activating components of the translational machinery including eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors) and eEFs (eukaryotic elongation factors). In the long term, insulin also increases the cellular content of ribosomes to augment the capacity for protein synthesis. The rapid activation of protein synthesis by insulin is mediated primarily through phosphoinositide 3-kinase. This involves the activation of PKB (protein kinase B). In one case, PKB acts to phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase kinase 3, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits eIF2B. Insulin elicits the dephosphorylation and activation of eIF2B. Since eIF2B is required for recycling of eIF2, a factor required for all cytoplasmic translation initiation events, this will contribute to overall activation of protein synthesis. PKB also phosphorylates the TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1)-TSC2 complex to relieve its inhibitory action on the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin markedly impairs insulin-activated protein synthesis. mTOR controls translation initiation and elongation. The cap-binding factor eIF4E can be sequestered in inactive complexes by 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1). Insulin elicits phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its release from eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to form initiation factor complexes. Insulin induces dephosphorylation and activation of eEF2 to accelerate elongation. Both effects are blocked by rapamycin. Insulin inactivates eEF2 kinase by increasing its phosphorylation at several mTOR-regulated sites. Insulin also stimulates synthesis of ribosomal proteins by promoting recruitment of their mRNAs into polyribosomes. This is inhibited by rapamycin. Several key questions remain about, for example, the mechanisms by which mTOR controls 4E-BP1 and eEF2 kinase and the control of ribosomal protein translation.",

    "issue": "70(8)",
    "pages": "3199-208",
    "abstract": "Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is a widely used antidepressant agent. Here, we show that sertraline also exhibits antiproliferative activity. Exposure to sertraline leads to a concentration-dependent decrease in protein synthesis. Moreover, polysome profile analysis of sertraline-treated cells shows a reduction in polysome content and a concomitant increase in 80S ribosomes. The inhibition in translation caused by sertraline is associated with decreased levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, altered localization of eIF4E, and increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The latter event leads to increased REDD1 expression, which in turn impinges on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by affecting TSC1/2 signaling. Sertraline also independently targets the mTOR signaling pathway downstream of Rheb. In the Emu-myc murine lymphoma model where carcinogenesis is driven by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) inactivation, sertraline is able to enhance chemosensitivity to doxorubicin. Our results indicate that sertraline exerts antiproliferative activity by targeting the mTOR signaling pathway in a REDD1-dependent manner.",

    "title": "Rapamycin: an anti-cancer immunosuppressant?",
    "issue": "56(1)",
    "pages": "47-60",
    "abstract": "Rapamycin and its derivatives are promising therapeutic agents with both immunosuppressant and anti-tumor properties. These rapamycin actions are mediated through the specific inhibition of the mTOR protein kinase. mTOR serves as part of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls the cell cycle in response to changing nutrient levels. The mTOR signaling network contains a number of tumor suppressor genes including PTEN, LKB1, TSC1, and TSC2, and a number of proto-oncogenes including PI3K, Akt, and eIF4E, and mTOR signaling is constitutively activated in many tumor types. These observations point to mTOR as an ideal target for anti-cancer agents and suggest that rapamycin is such an agent. In fact, early preclinical and clinical studies indicate that rapamycin derivatives have efficacy as anti-tumor agents both alone, and when combined with other modes of therapy. Rapamycin appears to inhibit tumor growth by halting tumor cell proliferation, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, and suppressing tumor angiogenesis. Rapamycin immunosuppressant actions result from the inhibition of T and B cell proliferation through the same mechanisms that rapamycin blocks cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, one might think that rapamycin-induced immunosuppression would be detrimental to the use of rapamycin as an anti-cancer agent. To the contrary, rapamycin decreases the frequency of tumor formation that occurs in organ transplant experiments when combined with the widely used immunosuppressant cyclosporine compared with the tumor incidence observed when cyclosporine is used alone. The available evidence indicates that with respect to tumor growth, rapamycin anti-cancer activities are dominant over rapamycin immunosuppressant effects.",

    "issue": "279(20)",
    "pages": "20816-23",
    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis gene products Tsc1 and Tsc2 behave as tumor suppressors by restricting cell growth, a function conserved among metazoans. Recent evidence has indicated that hyperactivation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) may represent an important biochemical change in the development of tuberous sclerosis-associated lesions. We show here that deletion of either Tsc1 or Tsc2 or expression of the Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase leads to hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 at a subset of regulatory sites, particularly those of two essential residues functionally conserved among AGC superfamily serine/threonine kinases, i.e. the activation loop (T-loop; Thr-229) and the hydrophobic motif (H-motif; Thr-389). These sites are reciprocally and dose-dependently regulated when S6K1 is coexpressed with the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex. Mutations that render S6K1 mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-resistant also protect S6K1 activity and phosphorylation from down-regulation by Tsc1/2. We demonstrate that two disease-associated mutations in Tsc2 fail to negatively regulate S6K1 activity concomitant with a failure to modify T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation. Finally, we identify one pathological Tsc2 mutation that retains its ability to negatively regulate S6K1, suggesting that, in some cases, tuberous sclerosis may develop independently of S6K1 hyperactivation. These results also highlight the importance of dual control of T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation of S6K1 by the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex.",

    "issue": "52(3)",
    "pages": "281-9",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex is a multiorgan disease resulting from a mutation of one of two TSC genes. The two gene products form a functional complex that regulates the mTOR signaling pathway (mTOR initially represented mammalian target of rapamycin, but increasingly the term mechanistic target of rapamycin is used to reflect the ubiquitous occurrence of mTOR). Epilepsy is the most common neurological symptom of tuberous sclerosis complex, occurring in 80% to 90% of affected individuals over the course of their lifetimes and causing significant morbidity and mortality. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is intricately involved in multiple cellular functions--including protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, and synaptic plasticity--which may influence neuronal excitability and precipitate epileptogenesis. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have increased interest in the potential role of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex-related epilepsy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedline and PubMed database searches were used to identify relevant studies and other information on tuberous sclerosis complex-related epilepsies, the mTOR pathway, and current advances in treatment approaches.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough current management strategies that provide symptomatic relief are effective at reducing the frequency of seizures in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex, there is further room for the exploration of therapies that directly address hyperactive mTOR signaling--the underlying etiology of the disease. The role of the antiepileptic effect of mTOR inhibition was first demonstrated in knockout TSC1 mouse models. Additionally, several case studies demonstrated a positive effect on seizure frequency and severity in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial with 28 patients, clinically relevant reduction in overall seizure frequency was documented in individuals treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. In a phase 3 trial evaluating the role of everolimus in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, seizures were a secondary end point. Because the median seizure frequency was zero in this study, the analysis was inconclusive.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nVarious preclinical models provide substantial evidence for the role of mTOR inhibition in the treatment of epilepsy in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex. Preliminary clinical studies provide supportive evidence for a role of mTOR inhibition in the management of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated epilepsy and pave the way for new randomized placebo-controlled studies. This article reviews current treatment recommendations for the management of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated epilepsy as well as the rationale and evidence to support the use of mTOR inhibitors.",

    "title": "The orphan receptor TR3 participates in angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by controlling mTOR signalling.",
    "issue": "5(1)",
    "pages": "137-48",
    "abstract": "Angiotensin II (AngII) induces cardiac hypertrophy and increases the expression of TR3. To determine whether TR3 is involved in the regulation of the pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by AngII, we established mouse and rat hypertrophy models using chronic AngII administration. Our results reveal that a deficiency of TR3 in mice or the knockdown of TR3 in the left ventricle of rats attenuated AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy compared with the respective controls. A mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the TR3-mediated activation of mTORC1 is associated with AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. TR3 was shown to form a trimer with the TSC1/TSC2 complex that specifically promoted TSC2 degradation via a proteasome/ubiquitination pathway. As a result, mTORC1, but not mTORC2, was activated; this was accompanied by increased protein synthesis, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and enlarged cell size, thereby resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. This study demonstrates that TR3 positively regulates cardiac hypertrophy by influencing the effect of AngII on the mTOR pathway. The elimination or reduction of TR3 may reduce cardiac hypertrophy; therefore, TR3 is a potential target for clinical therapy.",

    "issue": "12(14)",
    "pages": "2265-9",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nBetter understanding of aberrantly active molecular pathways in tumors offers potential to develop more specific and less toxic therapies. Abnormal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex signaling and defects in TSC1 and TSC2 have been associated with the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Recently, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown encouraging benefit for patients with SEGAs.\n\n\nAREAS COVERED\nThe authors discuss a molecular genetic pathway linked with TSC, specifically the role of two proteins whose functional absence is responsible for most SEGA tumors that arise in TSC patients. The authors also examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for patients with inoperable SEGAs.\n\n\nEXPERT OPINION\nEverolimus (Afinitor) selectively targets a molecular defect of SEGAs in TSC patients. Although surgery is effective, most SEGAs recur. An agent that inhibits an underlying molecular abnormality represents a particularly attractive therapeutic option for patients with inoperable or recurrent tumors. Studies are also underway to assess everolimus in treating other sequelae of TSC, and other gliomas. Finally, additional research aimed at better understanding aberrant cell signaling pathways may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "FRAP1 (FK506-binding protein 12-rapamycin complex-associated protein 1), a component of the nutrient-sensing cell signaling pathway, is critical for cell growth and metabolism. The present study determined expression of FRAP1 and associated members of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 cell signaling pathways in uteri of cyclic and pregnant ewes and conceptuses, as well as effects of pregnancy, progesterone (P4), and interferon tau (IFNT) on their expression. The mRNAs for FRAP1, LST8, MAPKAP1, RAPTOR, RICTOR, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, and EIF4EBP1 were localized to luminal, superficial glandular, and glandular epithelia and stromal cells of uteri from cyclic and pregnant ewes, as well as trophectoderm and endoderm of conceptuses between Days 13 and 18 of pregnancy. The abundance of FRAP1, RAPTOR, RICTOR, TSC1, and TSC2 mRNAs in endometria was unaffected by pregnancy status or by day of the estrous cycle or pregnancy; however, levels of LST8, MAPKAP1, RHEB, and EIF4EBP1 mRNA increased in endometria during early pregnancy. In ovariectomized ewes, P4 and IFNT stimulated expression of RHEB and EIF4EBP1 in uterine endometria. Total endometrial FRAP1 protein and phosphorylated FRAP1 protein levels were affected by pregnancy status and by day after onset of estrus, and phosphorylated FRAP1 protein was detected in nuclei of uterine epithelia and conceptuses. In endometria of pregnant ewes, increases in abundance of mRNAs for RICTOR, RHEB, and EIF4EBP1, as well as RHEB protein, correlated with rapid conceptus growth and development during the peri-implantation period. These results suggest that the FRAP1 cell signaling pathway mediates interactions between the maternal uterus and peri-implantation conceptuses and that P4 and IFNT affect this pathway by regulating expression of RHEB and EIF4EBP1.",

    "issue": "15(4)",
    "pages": "686-706",
    "abstract": "Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a small population of pluripotent cells residing within heterogeneous tumor mass, remain highly resistant to various chemotherapies as compared to the differentiated cancer cells. It is being postulated that CSCs possess unique molecular mechanisms, such as autophagic homeostasis, that allow CSCs to withstand the therapeutic assaults. Here we demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition differentially modulates macroautophagy/autophagy in CSCs as compared to that of differentiated cancer cells. Using human and murine CSC models and differentiated cells, we show that the inhibition or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 decreases CSC pluripotency by downregulating major pluripotency factors POU5F1, NANOG and SOX2. This decreased HDAC6 expression increases ACTB, TUBB3 and CSN2 expression and promotes differentiation in CSCs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically, HDAC6 KD in CSCs decreases pluripotency by promoting autophagy, whereas the inhibition of pluripotency via retinoic acid treatment, POU5F1 or autophagy-related gene (ATG7 and ATG12) KD in CSCs decreases HDAC6 expression and promotes differentiation. Interestingly, HDAC6 KD-mediated CSC growth inhibition is further enhanced in the presence of autophagy inducers Tat-Beclin 1 peptide and rapamycin. In contrast to the results observed in CSCs, HDAC6 KD in differentiated breast cancer cells downregulates autophagy and increases apoptosis. Furthermore, the autophagy regulator p-MTOR, upstream negative regulators of p-MTOR (TSC1 and TSC2) and downstream effectors of p-MTOR (p-RPS6KB and p-EIF4EBP1) are differentially regulated in CSCs versus differentiated cancer cells following HDAC6 KD. Overall these data identify the differential regulation of autophagy as a molecular link behind the differing chemo-susceptibility of CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy and other neurological deficits are common, disabling manifestations of the genetic disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Brain inflammation has been implicated in contributing to epileptogenesis in acquired epilepsy due to brain injury, but the potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in genetic epilepsies is relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated activation of inflammatory mediators and tested the effects of anti-inflammatory treatment on epilepsy in the Tsc1-GFAP conditional knock-out mouse model of TSC (Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting demonstrated increased expression of specific cytokines and chemokines, particularly IL-1β and CXCL10, in the neocortex and hippocampus of Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice, which was reversed by treatment with a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor. Double-labeling immunohistochemical studies indicated that the increased IL-1β was localized primarily to astrocytes. Importantly, the increase in inflammatory markers was also observed in astrocyte culture in vitro and at 2 weeks of age in Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice before the onset of epilepsy in vivo, indicating that the inflammatory changes were not secondary to seizures. Epicatechin-3-gallate, an inhibitor of IL-1β and CXCL10, at least partially reversed the elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, reduced seizure frequency, and prolonged survival of Tsc1(GFAP)CKO mice. These findings suggest that mTOR-mediated inflammatory mechanisms may be involved in epileptogenesis in the genetic epilepsy, TSC.",

    "issue": "299(4)",
    "pages": "L455-71",
    "abstract": "Lung development requires coordinated signaling between airway and vascular growth, but the link between these processes remains unclear. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) can amplify hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) vasculogenic activity through an NH(2)-terminal mTOR binding (TOS) motif. We hypothesized that this mechanism coordinates vasculogenesis with the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10/FGF-receptor2b/Spry2 regulator of airway branching. First, we tested if the HIF-1α TOS motif participated in epithelial-mesenchymal vascular signaling. mTORC1 activation by insulin significantly amplified HIF-1α activity at fetal Po(2) (23 mmHg) in human bronchial epithelium (16HBE14o-) and induced vascular traits (Flk1, sprouting) in cocultured human embryonic lung mesenchyme (HEL-12469). This enhanced activation of HIF-1α by mTORC1 was abolished on expression of a HIF-1α (F99A) TOS-mutant and also suppressed vascular differentiation of HEL-12469 cocultures. Next, we determined if vasculogenesis in fetal lung involved regulation of mTORC1 by the FGF-10/FGFR2b/Spry2 pathway. Fetal airway epithelium displayed distinct mTORC1 activity in situ, and its hyperactivation by TSC1(-/-) knockout induced widespread VEGF expression and disaggregation of Tie2-positive vascular bundles. FGF-10-coated beads grafted into fetal lung explants from Tie2-LacZ transgenic mice induced localized vascular differentiation in the peripheral mesenchyme. In rat fetal distal lung epithelial (FDLE) cells cultured at fetal Po(2), FGF-10 induced mTORC1 and amplified HIF-1α activity and VEGF secretion without induction of ERK1/2. This was accompanied by the formation of a complex between Spry2, the cCBL ubiquitin ligase, and the mTOR repressor, TSC2, which abolished GTPase activity directed against Rheb, the G protein inducer of mTORC1. Thus, mTORC1 links HIF-1α-driven vasculogenesis with the FGF-10/FGFR2b/Spry2 airway branching periodicity regulator.",

    "title": "Unkempt is negatively regulated by mTOR and uncouples neuronal differentiation from growth control.",
    "issue": "10(9)",
    "pages": "e1004624",
    "abstract": "Neuronal differentiation is exquisitely controlled both spatially and temporally during nervous system development. Defects in the spatiotemporal control of neurogenesis cause incorrect formation of neural networks and lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and autism. The mTOR kinase integrates signals from mitogens, nutrients and energy levels to regulate growth, autophagy and metabolism. We previously identified the insulin receptor (InR)/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of the timing of neuronal differentiation in the Drosophila melanogaster eye. Subsequently, this pathway has been shown to play a conserved role in regulating neurogenesis in vertebrates. However, the factors that mediate the neurogenic role of this pathway are completely unknown. To identify downstream effectors of the InR/mTOR pathway we screened transcriptional targets of mTOR for neuronal differentiation phenotypes in photoreceptor neurons. We identified the conserved gene unkempt (unk), which encodes a zinc finger/RING domain containing protein, as a negative regulator of the timing of photoreceptor differentiation. Loss of unk phenocopies InR/mTOR pathway activation and unk acts downstream of this pathway to regulate neurogenesis. In contrast to InR/mTOR signalling, unk does not regulate growth. unk therefore uncouples the role of the InR/mTOR pathway in neurogenesis from its role in growth control. We also identified the gene headcase (hdc) as a second downstream regulator of the InR/mTOR pathway controlling the timing of neurogenesis. Unk forms a complex with Hdc, and Hdc expression is regulated by unk and InR/mTOR signalling. Co-overexpression of unk and hdc completely suppresses the precocious neuronal differentiation phenotype caused by loss of Tsc1. Thus, Unk and Hdc are the first neurogenic components of the InR/mTOR pathway to be identified. Finally, we show that Unkempt-like is expressed in the developing mouse retina and in neural stem/progenitor cells, suggesting that the role of Unk in neurogenesis may be conserved in mammals.",

    "title": "Targeting the mTOR-DEPTOR pathway by CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases: therapeutic application.",
    "issue": "14(5)",
    "pages": "360-7",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, integrates both intracellular and extracellular signals and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, and autophagy. The mTOR pathway is frequently activated in many human cancers, mainly resulting from alterations in the upstream regulators, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activation, PTEN loss or dysregulation of mTOR-negative regulators (e.g., TSC1/2), leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Thus, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is widely considered as an effective approach for targeted cancer therapy. Recently, we and others found that DEPTOR, a naturally occurring inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, was degraded by SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligase, the founding member of cullin-RING-ligases (CRLs), resulting in mTOR activation and cell proliferation. In addition to DEPTOR, previous studies have demonstrated that several other negative regulators of mTOR pathway are also substrates of CRL/SCF E3s. Thus, targeting CRL/SCF E3s is expected to cause the accumulation of these mTOR signal inhibitors to effectively block the mTOR pathway. In this review, we will discuss mTOR signaling pathway, how DEPTOR regulates mTOR/AKT axis, thus acting as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in some cases, how DEPTOR is ubiquitinated and degraded by SCF(β-TrCP) E3, and how MLN4924, a small-molecule indirect inhibitor of CRL/SCF E3 ligases through blocking cullin neddylation, might be useful as a novel approach of mTOR pathway targeting for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 and TSC2 are the tumour-suppressor genes mutated in the tumour syndrome TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex). Their gene products form a complex that has become the focus of many signal transduction researchers. The TSC1-TSC2 (hamartin-tuberin) complex, through its GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity towards the small G-protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), is a critical negative regulator of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1). As mTORC1 activity controls anabolic processes to promote cell growth, it is exquisitely sensitive to alterations in cell growth conditions. Through numerous phosphorylation events, the TSC1-TSC2 complex has emerged as the sensor and integrator of these growth conditions, relaying signals from diverse cellular pathways to properly modulate mTORC1 activity. In the present review we focus on the molecular details of TSC1-TSC2 complex regulation and function as it relates to the control of Rheb and mTORC1.",

    "issue": "15(12)",
    "pages": "765-70",
    "abstract": "To maintain the length of reproductive life in a woman, it is essential that most of her ovarian primordial follicles are maintained in a quiescent state to provide a continuous supply of oocytes. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles is still in its infancy. In this study, we provide some genetic evidence to show that the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), which negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), functions in oocytes to maintain the dormancy of primordial follicles. In mutant mice lacking the Tsc2 gene in oocytes, the pool of primordial follicles is activated prematurely due to elevated mTORC1 activity in oocytes. This results in depletion of follicles in early adulthood, causing premature ovarian failure (POF). Our results suggest that the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex mediated suppression of mTORC1 activity is indispensable for maintenance of the dormancy of primordial follicles, thus preserving the follicular pool, and that mTORC1 activity in oocytes promotes follicular activation. Our results also indicate that deregulation of Tsc/mTOR signaling in oocytes may cause pathological conditions of the ovary such as infertility and POF.",

    "title": "Signal transduction molecules in gliomas of all grades.",
    "issue": "91(1)",
    "pages": "19-26",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo interrogate grade II, III, and IV gliomas and characterize the critical effectors within the PI3-kinase pathway upstream and downstream of mTOR. Experimental design Tissues from 87 patients who were treated at UCSF between 1990 and 2004 were analyzed. Twenty-eight grade II, 17 grade III glioma, 26 grade IV gliomas, and 16 non-tumor brain specimens were analyzed. Protein levels were assessed by immunoblots; RNA levels were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. To address the multiple comparisons, first an overall analysis was done comparing the four groups using Spearman's Correlation Coefficient. Only if this analysis was statistically significant were individual pairwise comparisons done.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultiple comparison analyses revealed a significant correlation with grade for all variables examined, except phosphorylated-S6. Expression of phosphorylated-4E-BP1, phosphorylated-PKB/Akt, PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 correlated with grade (P < 0.01 for all). We extended our analyses to ask whether decreases in TSC proteins levels were due to changes in mRNA levels, or due to changes in post-transcriptional alterations. We found significantly lower levels of TSC1 and TSC2 mRNA in GBMs than in grade II gliomas or non-tumor brain (P < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExpression levels of critical signaling molecules upstream and downstream of mTOR differ between non-tumor brain and gliomas of any grade. The single variable whose expression did not differ between non-tumor brain and gliomas was phosphorylated-S6, suggesting that other protein kinases, in addition to mTOR, contribute significantly to S6 phosphorylation. mTOR provides a rational therapeutic target in gliomas of all grades, and clinical benefit may emerge as mTOR inhibitors are combined with additional agents.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that regulate T cell quiescence are poorly understood. We report that the tumor suppressor Tsc1 established a quiescence program in naive T cells by controlling cell size, cell cycle entry and responses to stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor. Abrogation of quiescence predisposed Tsc1-deficient T cells to apoptosis that resulted in loss of conventional T cells and invariant natural killer T cells. Loss of Tsc1 function dampened in vivo immune responses to bacterial infection. Tsc1-deficient T cells had more activity of the serine-threonine kinase complex mTORC1 but less mTORC2 activity, and activation of mTORC1 was essential for the disruption of immune homeostasis. Therefore, Tsc1-dependent control of mTOR is crucial in actively maintaining the quiescence of naive T cells to facilitate adaptive immune function.",

    "issue": "407()",
    "pages": "542-55",
    "abstract": "More than 10 years ago, Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) was identified as a highly conserved protein that is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which play critical roles in cell growth and proliferation. Recently, a convergence of genetic and biochemical evidence from yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells has placed Rheb upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and immediately downstream of the tumor suppressors TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin). Rheb plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth in response to growth factors, nutrients, and amino acids linking PI3K and TOR signaling. Rheb activation of the nutrient and energy-sensitive TOR pathway leads to the direct phosphorylation of two known downstream translational control targets by mTOR, the 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)- binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Appropriate regulation of this pathway is crucial for the proper control of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Inappropriate regulation of these signaling molecules, therefore, can lead to a variety of human diseases. In this chapter, we describe cell biological and biochemical methods commonly used to study Rheb activation and dissect its role in the mTOR-signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The molecular interplay between the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in the control of cell growth and proliferation has been the subject of much interest and debate amongst cell biologists. A recent escalation of research in this area has come from the discovery of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene products, tuberin and hamartin, as central regulators of mTOR activation. The PI3K effector Akt/protein kinase B has been found to directly phosphorylate tuberin and is thereby thought to activate mTOR through inhibition of the tuberin-hamartin complex. The many recent studies aimed at defining the molecular nature of this revamped PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are reviewed here. The collective data discussed have laid the groundwork for important new insights into the many cancers caused by aberrant PI3K activation and the clinically challenging tuberous sclerosis complex disease and have suggested a possible means of treatment for both.",

    "abstract": "Animal models of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are highly desired to enable detailed investigation of the pathogenesis of these diseases. Multiple rats and mice have been generated in which a mutation similar to that occurring in TSC patients is present in an allele of Tsc1 or Tsc2. Unfortunately, these mice do not develop pathologic lesions that match those seen in LAM or TSC. However, these Tsc rodent models have been useful in confirming the two-hit model of tumor development in TSC, and in providing systems in which therapeutic trials (e.g., rapamycin) can be performed. In addition, conditional alleles of both Tsc1 and Tsc2 have provided the opportunity to target loss of these genes to specific tissues and organs, to probe the in vivo function of these genes, and attempt to generate better models. Efforts to generate an authentic LAM model are impeded by a lack of understanding of the cell of origin of this process. However, ongoing studies provide hope that such a model will be generated in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that is associated with multiple neurological manifestations. Previously, we demonstrated that Tsc1 loss in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) can cause altered social behavior in mice. Here, we performed detailed transcriptional and translational analyses of Tsc1-deficient PCs to understand the molecular alterations in these cells. We found that target transcripts of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) are reduced in mutant PCs with evidence of increased degradation. Surprisingly, we observed unchanged ribosomal binding for many of these genes using translating ribosome affinity purification. Finally, we found that multiple FMRP targets, including SHANK2, were reduced, suggesting that compensatory increases in ribosomal binding efficiency may be unable to overcome reduced transcript levels. These data further implicate dysfunction of FMRP and its targets in TSC and suggest that treatments aimed at restoring the function of these pathways may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are common cancers diagnosed in more than 350,000 people each year worldwide. Several pathways are de-regulated in RCCs, including mTORC1. However, how mTOR drives tumorigenesis in this context is unknown. The lack of faithful animal models has limited progress in understanding and targeting RCCs. Here, we generated a mouse model harboring the kidney-specific inactivation of Tsc1. These animals develop cysts that evolve into papillae, cystadenomas, and papillary carcinomas. Global profiling confirmed several metabolic derangements previously attributed to mTORC1. Notably, Tsc1 inactivation results in the accumulation of fumarate and in mTOR-dependent downregulation of the TCA cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH). The re-expression of FH in cellular systems lacking Tsc1 partially rescued renal epithelial transformation. Importantly, the mTORC1-FH axis is likely conserved in human RCC specimens. We reveal a role of mTORC1 in renal tumorigenesis, which depends on the oncometabolite fumarate.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare neoplastic disease affecting predominantly young women. Clinical symptoms of this progressive disease include dyspnoea, cough, recurrent pneumothorax, hemoptysis and chylothorax. LAM is generally aggressive in nature and ultimately results in respiratory failure. Important hallmark features of this metastatic disease include the formation of lesions of abnormal smooth muscle cells, cystic destruction of the lung tissue and lymphangiogenesis affecting the lungs, abdomen and lymphatics. Research over the last 10-15 years has significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular and cellular processes associated with LAM. These processes include mutational inactivation of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, TSC1 and TSC2, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, enhanced cell proliferation and migration, lymphangiogenesis, metastatic spread through the blood and lymphatic circulations, sex steroid sensitivity and dysregulated autophagy. Despite this increased knowledge there is currently no cure for LAM and treatment options remain limited. Whilst the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has shown some benefit in patients with LAM, with stabilisation of lung function and improved quality of life, cessation of treatment results in recurrence of the disease progression. This highlights the urgent need to identify novel targets and new treatment regimens. The focus of this review is to summarise our current understanding of the cellular and molecular processes associated with LAM and highlight emerging treatments.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by involvement of skin, nervous system, kidneys, and lungs. It results from mutations in 1 of 2 genes: TSC1 (encoding hamartin) or TSC2 (encoding tuberin), leading to dysregulation and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Constitutive activation of mTOR signaling has recently been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and inhibition of this pathway may benefit patients with SLE nephritis. We report a case of a young woman with tuberous sclerosis who developed fulminant SLE, with lower extremity edema, massive proteinuria, and class IV lupus glomerulonephritis. She died despite treatment with high-dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide. Although there are no prior reports of coexistence of these 2 rare diseases, this case is of considerable interest because of the possibility that activation of mTOR by the TSC mutations may have led to activation of the immune system and the development of unusually severe SLE.",

We previously demonstrated that a subset of eosinophilic renal tumors with heterogeneous morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining harbored pathogenic mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) as the primary defining mutation. We identified an additional 8 cases of eosinophilic tumors with unusual morphology that were originally diagnosed as chromophobe RCC (CHRCC) or CHRCC, eosinophilic variant. As a comparison, we included four classic CHRCC cases and one CHRCC, eosinophilic variant case. Gross examination revealed solid or solid and cystic patterns. The solid areas were composed of eosinophilic tumor cells divided by congested vessels, whereas the cystic areas were lined by cytologically bland eosinophilic cells with septae containing nests, ribbons, and single eosinophilic tumor cells. The tumor cells had abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. IHC analysis demonstrated diffuse staining for CK7 and negative staining for CK20 and vimentin. Next-generation sequencing identified pathogenic variants in three genes: TSC1, TSC2, and MTOR. They also lacked significant copy number variations in contrast to our control cases. We have demonstrated with our expanded study that cases previously diagnosed as CHRCC or CHRCC, eosinophilic variant with discordant histology and IHC staining patterns may represent a separate subtype of RCC characterized by mutations in the TSC/MTOR pathway.",

    "issue": "9(12)",
    "pages": "2069-86",
    "abstract": "Hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) is a common feature of human cancers, and MTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, are thus becoming therapeutics in targeting certain cancers. However, rapamycin has also been found to compromise the efficacy of chemotherapeutics to cells with hyperactive MTOR. Here, we show that loss of TSC2 or PTEN enhanced etoposide-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, which was blunted by suppression of MTOR with either rapamycin or RNA interference. cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates genes involved in survival and death, was positively regulated by MTOR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and cancer cell lines. Silencing Creb1 expression with siRNA protected MTOR-hyperactive cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, loss of TSC2 or PTEN impaired either etoposide or nutrient starvation-induced autophagy, which in turn, leads to CREB1 hyperactivation. We further elucidated an inverse correlation between autophagy activity and CREB1 activity in the kidney tumor tissue obtained from a TSC patient and the mouse livers with hepatocyte-specific knockout of PTEN. CREB1 induced DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis in response to etoposide in autophagy-defective cells. Reactivation of CREB1 or inhibition of autophagy not only improved the efficacy of rapamycin but also alleviated MTOR inhibition-mediated chemoresistance. Therefore, autophagy suppression of CREB1 may underlie the MTOR inhibition-mediated chemoresistance. We suggest that inhibition of MTOR in combination with CREB1 activation may be used in the treatment of cancer caused by an abnormal PI3K-PTEN-AKT-TSC1/2-MTOR signaling pathway. CREB1 activators should potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics in treatment of these cancers.",

    "issue": "2018()",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem hereditary cutaneous condition, characterized by multiple hamartomas. In rare cases, pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) have been described in patients with TSC, but the causal relationship between these two diseases is still under debate. TSC is mostly caused by mutations of two tumor suppressor genes, encoding for hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), controlling cell growth and proliferation. Here, we present the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian woman with TSC and a silent gonadotroph PitNET with suprasellar extension, treated with transsphenoidal endoscopic neurosurgery with complete resection. Therapeutic approaches based on mTOR signaling (i.e. everolimus) have been successfully used in patients with TSC and tested in non-functioning PitNET cellular models with promising results. Here, we observed a reduction of cell viability after an in vitro treatment of PitNET's derived primary cells with everolimus. TSC analysis retrieved no disease-associated variants with the exception of the heterozygous intronic variant c.4006-71C>T found in TSC2: the computational tools predicted a gain of a new splice site with consequent intron retention, not confirmed by an in vitro analysis of patient's lymphocyte-derived RNA. Further analyses are therefore needed to provide insights on the possible mechanisms involving the hamartin-tuberin complex in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas. However, our data further support previous observations of an antiproliferative effect of everolimus on PitNET.\n\n\nLEARNING POINTS\nPituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNET) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are rare: only few cases have been reported in literature.Therapeutic approach related to mTOR signaling, such as everolimus, may be used in some patients with PitNETs as well as those with TSC.We reported a woman with both non-secreting PitNET and TSC; PitNET was surgically removed and classified as a silent gonadotroph tumor.Everolimus treatment in PitNET's-derived primary cells revealed a significant decrease in cell viability.Considering our case and available evidence, it is still unclear whether a PitNET is a part of TSC or just a coincidental tumor.",

    "issue": "20(10)",
    "pages": "1697-704",
    "abstract": "The bipartite transcription factor beta-catenin/TCF (cat/TCF) has been recognized as the major effector of the Wnt signaling pathway for more than a decade, and its over-activation has been associated with malignancy such as colon and breast cancer. Extensive examination in different cell lineages has shown that the activity of cat/TCF can be stimulated by mechanisms other than via the Wnt glycoproteins, including the stimulation of beta-cat nuclear translocation and enhanced binding of cat/TCF to the Wnt target gene promoters by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In addition, the heterotrimeric G proteins of the G(12) subfamily can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins, resulting in the release of the transcriptional activator beta-cat. Furthermore, certain peptide hormones may stimulate cat/TCF-mediated gene transcription via activation of their corresponding G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3 has been recognized to coordinate with AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) in phosphorylation and activation of TSC2, the major component of the tumor suppressor complex TSC1/2. Thus, Wnt activation can stimulate protein translation via GSK-3 and TSC1/2 inactivation, followed by mTOR activation. Finally, beta-cat also functions as a pivotal molecule in defense against oxidative stress via serving as a partner of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors. Thus, FOXO proteins, which mainly mediate aging and stress signaling, and TCF factors, which mainly mediate developmental and proliferation signaling, compete for a limited pool of free beta-cat. Insulin and growth factors, on the other hand, control the balance between TCF- and FOXO-mediated gene transcription via phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FOXO proteins. These observations provide new insight to understand how Wnt, insulin/growth factors, and FOXOs are involved in versatile physiological events and the development and progression of various human diseases.",

    "pages": "149-163",
    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a disease caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and is characterized by tumor susceptibility, brain lesions, seizures and behavioral impairments. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode proteins forming a complex (TSC), which is a major regulator and suppressor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a signaling complex that promotes cell growth and proliferation. TSC1/2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and the subsequent complete loss of TSC regulatory activity in null cells causes mTORC1 dysregulation and TSC-associated brain lesions or other tissue tumors. However, it is not clear whether TSC1/2 heterozygous brain cells are abnormal and contribute to TSC neuropathology. To investigate this issue, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TSC patients and unaffected controls, and utilized these to obtain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and differentiated neurons in vitro. These patient-derived TSC2 heterozygous NPCs were delayed in their ability to differentiate into neurons. Patient-derived progenitor cells also exhibited a modest activation of mTORC1 signaling downstream of TSC, and a marked attenuation of upstream PI3K/AKT signaling. We further show that pharmacologic PI3K or AKT inhibition, but not mTORC1 inhibition, causes a neuronal differentiation delay, mimicking the patient phenotype. Together these data suggest that heterozygous TSC2 mutations disrupt neuronal development, potentially contributing to the disease neuropathology, and that this defect may result from dysregulated PI3K/AKT signaling in neural progenitor cells.",

    "issue": "32(39)",
    "pages": "4702-11",
    "abstract": "The protein complex of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and TSC2 tumor suppressors is a key negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Hyperactive mTOR signaling due to the loss-of-function of mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene causes TSC, an autosomal dominant disorder featured with benign tumors in multiple organs. As the ubiquitous second messenger calcium (Ca(2+)) regulates various cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis, we explored the potential role of mTOR in modulation of cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and in turn the effect of Ca(2+) signaling in TSC-related tumor development. We found that loss of Tsc2 potentiated store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent way. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), was upregulated in Tsc2-deficient cells, and was suppressed by mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. In addition, SOCE repressed AKT1 phosphorylation. Blocking SOCE either by depleting STIM1 or ectopically expressing dominant-negative Orai1 accelerated TSC-related tumor development, likely because of restored AKT1 activity and enhanced tumor angiogenesis. Our data, therefore, suggest that mTORC1 enhancement of store-operated Ca(2+) signaling hinders TSC-related tumor growth through suppression of AKT1 signaling. The augmented SOCE by hyperactive mTORC1-STIM1 cascade may contribute to the benign nature of TSC-related tumors. Application of SOCE agonists could thus be a contraindication for TSC patients. In contrast, SOCE agonists should attenuate mTOR inhibitors-mediated AKT reactivation and consequently potentiate their efficacy in the treatment of the patients with TSC.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a relatively rare group of heterogeneous tumours originating from neuroendocrine cells found throughout the body. Pancreatic NENs (PanNENs) are the second most common pancreatic malignancy accounting for 1-3% of all neoplasms developing in the pancreas. Despite having a low background mutation rate, driver mutations in MEN1, DAXX/ATRX and mTOR pathway genes (PTEN, TSC1/2) are implicated in disease development and progression. Their increased incidence coupled with advances in sequencing technologies has reignited the interest in PanNEN research and has accelerated the acquisition of molecular data. Studies utilising such technological advances have further enriched our knowledge of PanNENs' biology through novel findings, including higher-than-expected presence of germline mutations in 17% of sporadic tumours of no familial background, identification of novel mutational signatures and complex chromosomal rearrangements and a dysregulated epigenetic machinery. Integrated genomic studies have progressed the field by identifying the synergistic action between different molecular mechanisms, while holding the promise for deciphering disease heterogeneity. Although our understanding is far from being complete, these novel findings have provided the optimism of shaping the future of PanNEN research, ultimately leading to an era of precision medicine for NETs. Here, we recapitulate the existing knowledge on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) and discuss how recent, novel findings have furthered our understanding of these complex tumours.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate miR-21 expression in the serum of two groups of TSC patients: with or without SEGA tumors. We found no differences in the level of miR-21 depending on the presence of SEGA. Next, we studied the influence of prolonged rapamycin administration on miR-21 level in the blood serum of TSC patients (6-12 months of rapamycin) and in primary cultures of SEGA-derived cells treated with rapamycin in vitro. Here we show that rapamycin treatment leads to the upregulation of miR-21 in both patients' serum and in primary SEGA tumor cells in the culture indicating the regulatory relationship between rapamycin treatment and miR-21 expression.",

    "pages": "6159-6163",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that varies greatly in its expression. The current study reports a novel case of TSC caused by a TSC2 mutation (TSC2c.1642_1643insA or TSC2p.K549fsX589), in which multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas were detected by fetal echocardiography in week 31 of pregnancy. The infant was delivered successfully; however, seizures began 16 days following birth. Subsequent genetic tests confirmed a diagnosis of TSC. Rapamycin treatment resulted in regression of cardiac rhabdomyomas and controlled seizures. The current study demonstrates the value of fetal echocardiography in the diagnosis of TSC and suggests that inhibition of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway may be considered as a potential antiepileptogenic therapy for neonatal TSC. In addition, it was demonstrated that rapamycin treatment was therapeutically beneficial for preventing disorders caused by abnormal mTOR signaling, such as cancer. According to the literature, cardiac rhabdomyomas, seizures and skin lesions are well established markers for TSC in neonates. MRI scans of the brain and genetic screening of TSC1 and TSC2 genes may facilitate an early diagnosis of TSC.",

    "issue": "296(3)",
    "pages": "C583-92",
    "abstract": "The protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is well established as a key regulator of skeletal muscle size. In this study, we determined that the stress responsive gene REDD2 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 2) is a negative regulator of mTOR signaling and is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of REDD2 in muscle cells significantly inhibited basal mTOR signaling and diminished the response of mTOR to leucine addition or mechanical stretch. The inhibitory function of REDD2 on mTOR signaling seems to be mediated downstream or independent of Akt signaling and upstream of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain). Knock down of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) using small interfering (si)RNA potently activated mTOR signaling and was sufficient to rescue REDD2 inhibition of mTOR activity, suggesting that REDD2 functions by modulating TSC2 function. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that REDD2 does not directly interact with either TSC1 or TSC2. However, we found that REDD2 forms a complex with 14-3-3 protein and that increasing expression of REDD2 acts to competitively dissociate TSC2 from 14-3-3 and inhibits mTOR signaling. These findings demonstrate that REDD2 is a skeletal muscle specific inhibitory modulator of mTOR signaling and identify TSC2 and 14-3-3 as key molecular links between REDD2 and mTOR function.",

    "abstract": "The control of cell growth, that is cell size, is largely controlled by mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), a large serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. mTOR activity is regulated both by the availability of growth factors, such as insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), and by nutrients, notably the supply of certain key amino acids. The last few years have seen a remarkable increase in our understanding of the canonical, growth factor-regulated pathway for mTOR activation, which is mediated by the class I PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases), PKB (protein kinase B), TSC1/2 (the tuberous sclerosis complex) and the small GTPase, Rheb. However, the nutrient-responsive input into mTOR is important in its own right and is also required for maximal activation of mTOR signalling by growth factors. Despite this, the details of the nutrient-responsive signalling pathway(s) controlling mTOR have remained elusive, although recent studies have suggested a role for the class III PI3K hVps34. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Findlay et al. demonstrate that the protein kinase MAP4K3 [mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase-3, a Ste20 family protein kinase also known as GLK (germinal centre-like kinase)] is a new component of the nutrient-responsive pathway. MAP4K3 activity is stimulated by administration of amino acids, but not growth factors, and this is insensitive to rapamycin, most likely placing MAP4K3 upstream of mTOR. Indeed, MAP4K3 is required for phosphorylation of known mTOR targets such as S6K1 (S6 kinase 1), and overexpression of MAP4K3 promotes the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of these same targets. Finally, knockdown of MAP4K3 levels causes a decrease in cell size. The results suggest that MAP4K3 is a new component in the nutrient-responsive pathway for mTOR activation and reveal a completely new function for MAP4K3 in promoting cell growth. Given that mTOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer, there is much interest in new strategies for inhibition of this pathway. In this context, MAP4K3 looks like an attractive drug target since inhibitors of this enzyme should switch off mTOR, thereby inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, and promoting apoptosis.",

    "issue": "42(9)",
    "pages": "1166-1181",
    "abstract": "Eosinophilic solid and cystic (ESC) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has recently been described as a potentially new subtype of RCC based upon morphologic and immunohistochemical features. These neoplasms typically demonstrate solid and cystic architecture, and the neoplastic cells contain voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm with granular cytoplasmic stippling. There is frequently focal immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 20. Although the initial cases all occurred in adult females and had benign outcome, we recently expanded the proposed spectrum of this neoplasm to include pediatric cases, multifocal neoplasms, and a case with hematogenous metastasis. ESC has been postulated to be analogous to a subtype of RCC consistently identified in tuberous sclerosis complex patients, and while previous work has demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at the TSC1 locus and copy number gains at TSC2 in ESC RCC, these genes have not been sequenced in ESC RCC. Using capture-based and amplicon-based next-generation sequencing, we now demonstrate the consistent presence of either TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations in pediatric ESC RCC (8/9 cases) and adult ESC RCC (6/6 cases). These included a metastatic ESC RCC which had a complete response to mTOR targeted therapy. We also found these mutations in some neoplasms with variant morphology and thus potentially expand the spectrum of ESC RCC. These include one of our adult cases which demonstrated dominant \"type 2\" papillary RCC morphology and 2 of 3 previously unclassified pediatric RCC with features of ESC RCC minus granular cytoplasmic stippling. We also demonstrate TSC mutations in a case of so-called \"oncocytoid RCC after neuroblastoma\" with identical morphology and immunoprofile, providing a molecular link between the latter and ESC RCC. In summary, ESC RCC consistently harbors actionable TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, which are infrequently seen in established subtypes of RCC. These findings support TSC1/2 mutation as a molecular marker of ESC RCC, and suggest expansion of the clinicopathologic spectrum to include neoplasms with papillary architecture, occasional cases lacking well-developed granular cytoplasmic stippling, and a subset of RCC with oncocytic features in patients who have survived neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder that affects the brain in almost every patient. It is caused by a mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key player in control of cellular growth and protein synthesis. The most frequent neurological symptoms are seizures, which occur in up to 90% of patients and often are intractable, followed by autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and sleep problems. Conventional treatment has frequently proven insufficient for neurological and behavioral symptoms, particularly seizure control. This review focuses on the role of TSC/mTOR in neuronal development and network formation and recent mechanism-based treatment approaches.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a literature review to identify ongoing therapeutic challenges and novel strategies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTo achieve a better quality of life for many patients, current therapy approaches are directed at restoring dysregulated mTOR signaling. Studies in animals have provided insight into aberrant neuronal network formation caused by constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway, and initial studies in TSC patients using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and electroencephalogram support a model of impaired neuronal connectivity in TSC. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, has been used successfully in Tsc-deficient mice to prevent and treat seizures and behavioral abnormalities. There is recent evidence in humans of improved seizure control with mTOR inhibitors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCurrent research provides insight into aberrant neuronal connectivity in TSC and the role of mTOR inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach.",

    "pages": "108297",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell proliferation, growth and survival, and is activated in cancer and neurological disorders, including epilepsy. The rapamycin derivative (\"rapalog\") everolimus, which allosterically inhibits the mTOR pathway, is approved for the treatment of partial epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In contrast to the efficacy in TSC, the efficacy of rapalogs on SRS in other types of epilepsy is equivocal. Furthermore, rapalogs only poorly penetrate into the brain and are associated with peripheral adverse effects, which may compromise their therapeutic efficacy. Here we compare the antiseizure efficacy of two novel, brain-permeable ATP-competitive and selective mTORC1/2 inhibitors, PQR620 and PQR626, and the selective dual pan-PI3K/mTORC1/2 inhibitor PQR530 in two mouse models of chronic epilepsy with SRS, the intrahippocampal kainate (IHK) mouse model of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy and Tsc1GFAP CKO mice, a well-characterized mouse model of epilepsy in TSC. During prolonged treatment of IHK mice with rapamycin, everolimus, PQR620, PQR626, or PQR530; only PQR620 exerted a transient antiseizure effect on SRS, at well tolerated doses whereas the other compounds were ineffective. In contrast, all of the examined compounds markedly suppressed SRS in Tsc1GFAP CKO mice during chronic treatment at well tolerated doses. Thus, against our expectation, no clear differences in antiseizure efficacy were found across the three classes of mTOR inhibitors examined in mouse models of genetic and acquired epilepsies. The main advantage of the novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives is their excellent tolerability compared to rapalogs, which would favor their development as new therapies for TORopathies such as TSC.",

Common TSC features include brain lesions, such as cortical tubers and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). However, the current treatment with mTOR inhibitors has critical limitations. We aimed to identify new targets for TSC pharmacotherapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of our shRNA screen point to glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), a key enzyme in glutathione synthesis, as a contributor to TSC-related phenotype. GCLC inhibition increased cellular stress and reduced mTOR hyperactivity in TSC2-depleted neurons and SEGA-derived cells. Moreover, patients' brain tubers showed elevated GCLC and stress markers expression. Finally, GCLC inhibition led to growth arrest and death of SEGA-derived cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe describe GCLC as a part of redox adaptation in TSC, needed for overgrowth and survival of mutant cells, and provide a potential novel target for SEGA treatment.",

    "pages": "572-83",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Tremendous progress in understanding the pathogenesis of TSC has been made in recent years, along with initial trials of medical treatment aimed specifically at the underlying mechanism of the disorder. At the cellular level, loss of TSC1 or TSC2 results in upregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. At the circuitry level, TSC and mTOR play crucial roles in axonal, dendritic, and synaptic development and function. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism underlying TSC, and how this disease results in aberrant neural connectivity at multiple levels in the central nervous system, leading to ASD symptoms. We then review recent advances in mechanism-based treatments of TSC, and the promise that these treatments provide for future mechanism-based treatment of ASD. Because of these recent advances, TSC represents an ideal model for how to make progress in understanding and treating the mechanisms that underlie ASD in general.",

    "issue": "7(11)",
    "pages": "e00857",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe goal of this study was to identify changes in quantitative and qualitative aspects of neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations USVs in neuron-subset specific (NS-Pten) knockout males and females when compared with wild-type male and female mice.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nOne signaling cascade that plays a crucial role in the development of an autistic-like phenotype is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Mouse models that illustrate this connection include Fmr1, Tsc1, and NS-Pten-deficient mice. While numerous studies have investigated ultrasonic vocalizations in Fmr1 knockout and Tsc1 heterogenous mice, none have investigated USVs in NS-Pten knockout mice using a full spectrum recording system.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recorded ultrasonic vocalizations from NS-Pten wild-type and knockout male and female mice on postnatal days 8 and 11. On these days, we measured the number and quality of calls emitted from pups when they were removed from their mothers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that knockout pups emitted fewer vocalizations for both sexes (p < .05). Knockout males had calls of a shorter duration and lower peak amplitude on day 8, while showing a shorter duration, lower peak amplitude, and higher peak and fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Knockout females vocalized at a lower peak amplitude and fundamental frequency, and a higher peak frequency on day 8, while showing a shorter duration and a higher peak and fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Spectrographic analyses also revealed significant differences in call type for both genotypes and sexes (p < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings demonstrate that deletion of NS-Pten results in significant decreases in vocalizations across both sexes. Additionally, our findings indicate that the aberrant vocalizations and increased call duration seen in other mTOR models are also present in NS-Pten knockout mice. Our study provides evidence of a connection between hyperactive mTOR signaling and neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations.",

    "issue": "22(1)",
    "pages": "140-52",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged. Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile. Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow activity was seen on electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and have reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and increased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of mTORC2 signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic manifestations seen in TSC.",

    "abstract": "mTOR is a major biological switch, coordinating an adequate response to changes in energy uptake (amino acids, glucose), growth signals (hormones, growth factors) and environmental stress. mTOR kinase is highly conserved through evolution from yeast to man and in both cases, controls autophagy and cellular translation in response to nutrient stress. mTOR kinase is the catalytic component of two distinct multiprotein complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. In addition to mTOR, mTORC1 contains Raptor, mLST8 and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, Rictor, mSIN1 and Protor-1. mTORC1 activates p70S6K, which in turn phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1, both involved in protein translation. mTORC2 activates AKT directly by phosphorylating Serine 473. pAKT(S473) phosphorylates TSC2 (tuberin) and inactivates it, preventing its association with TSC1 (hamartin) and the inhibition of Rheb, an activator of mTOR. pAKT also phosphorylates PRAS40, releasing it from the mTORC1 complex, increasing its kinase activity. Finally, AKT regulates FOXO3 phosphorylation, sequestering it in the cytosol in an inactive state.",

    "title": "Effects of rapamycin in the Eker rat model of tuberous sclerosis complex.",
    "issue": "57(1)",
    "pages": "67-75",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) presents in the pediatric population with a constellation of benign tumors that affect the brain, heart, kidney, lung, and skin. No therapy has been shown to halt disease progression or to prevent its onset. The pathogenesis of TSC stems from the inactivation of one of the two TSC genes, TSC1 and TSC2. A key function of these genes is to regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in response to cellular energy and nutrient and growth factor availability. Consequently, TSC-related tumors exhibit uncontrolled activation of mTOR and its effectors. Previous work has shown that a specific mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, effectively down-regulated mTOR activity in renal tumors of Eker rats that carry a germline Tsc2 mutation. Using this model, we investigated the effects of rapamycin on pituitary and renal tumors. We observed that rats with pituitary tumors had significantly shorter survival than those without pituitary pathology. Treatment with rapamycin effectively improved their clinical state and prolonged their survival. Rapamycin also resulted in a significant decrease in the size of the Tsc2-related renal tumors. In both types of pathology, tumor response was accompanied by down-regulation of ribosomal S6 kinase activity, reduction in cell size, and induction of apoptosis. Evidence for drug resistance was found in a small percentage of lesions after prolonged therapy. When rapamycin was given before onset of disease, subsequent development of macroscopic renal tumors was reduced, but no effect on the number of microscopic precursor lesions was found. We conclude that rapamycin-sensitive mTOR activity was critical to tumor progression in the Eker rat model, but rapamycin is unlikely to eradicate all disease as a result of the development of drug resistance. Our data also suggest the role of a rapamycin-insensitive pathway during tumor initiation.",

    "issue": "25(19)",
    "pages": "4244-4255",
    "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an incurable neurodegenerative condition featuring photoreceptor death that leads to blindness. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for photoreceptor degenerative conditions like RP and atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there are promising results in human gene therapy, RP is a genetically diverse disorder, such that gene-specific therapies would be practical in a small fraction of patients with RP. Here, we explore a non-gene-specific strategy that entails reprogramming photoreceptors towards anabolism by upregulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We conditionally ablated the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) gene, an mTOR inhibitor, in the rods of the Pde6bH620Q/H620Q preclinical RP mouse model and observed, functionally and morphologically, an improvement in the survival of rods and cones at early and late disease stages. These results elucidate the ability of reprogramming the metabolome to slow photoreceptor degeneration. This strategy may also be applicable to a wider range of neurodegenerative diseases, as enhancement of nutrient uptake is not gene-specific and is implicated in multiple pathologies. Enhancing anabolism promoted neuronal survival and function and could potentially benefit a number of photoreceptor and other degenerative conditions.",

    "issue": "10()",
    "pages": "620",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways.",

    "issue": "29(14)",
    "pages": "3991-4001",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) interacts with raptor to form the protein complex mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1), which plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth in response to environmental cues. Given that glucose is a primary fuel source and a biosynthetic precursor, how mTORC1 signaling is coordinated with glucose metabolism has been an important question. Here, we found that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) binds Rheb and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Under low-glucose conditions, GAPDH prevents Rheb from binding to mTOR and thereby inhibits mTORC1 signaling. High glycolytic flux suppresses the interaction between GAPDH and Rheb and thus allows Rheb to activate mTORC1. Silencing of GAPDH or blocking of the Rheb-GAPDH interaction desensitizes mTORC1 signaling to changes in the level of glucose. The GAPDH-dependent regulation of mTORC1 in response to glucose availability occurred even in TSC1-deficient cells and AMPK-silenced cells, supporting the idea that the GAPDH-Rheb pathway functions independently of the AMPK axis. Furthermore, we show that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate that binds GAPDH, destabilizes the Rheb-GAPDH interaction even under low-glucose conditions, explaining how high-glucose flux suppresses the interaction and activates mTORC1 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that the glycolytic flux regulates mTOR's access to Rheb by regulating the Rheb-GAPDH interaction, thereby allowing mTORC1 to coordinate cell growth with glucose availability.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is mediated by two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, has been implicated in several neurological disorders1-3. Individuals carrying loss-of-function mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, a negative regulator of mTOR signaling, are prone to developing macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), seizures and intellectual disability2,4,5. It is generally believed that the neurological symptoms associated with loss of PTEN and other mTORopathies (for example, mutations in the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 or TSC2) are due to hyperactivation of mTORC1-mediated protein synthesis1,2,4,6,7. Using molecular genetics, we unexpectedly found that genetic deletion of mTORC2 (but not mTORC1) activity prolonged lifespan, suppressed seizures, rescued ASD-like behaviors and long-term memory, and normalized metabolic changes in the brain of mice lacking Pten. In a more therapeutically oriented approach, we found that administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting mTORC2's defining component Rictor specifically inhibits mTORC2 activity and reverses the behavioral and neurophysiological abnormalities in adolescent Pten-deficient mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that mTORC2 is the major driver underlying the neuropathophysiology associated with Pten-deficiency, and its therapeutic reduction could represent a promising and broadly effective translational therapy for neurological disorders where mTOR signaling is dysregulated.",

    "issue": "521()",
    "pages": "111108",
    "abstract": "REV-ERBα is a nuclear receptor that inhibits Bmal1 transcription as part of the circadian clock molecular mechanism. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell and whole-body energy homeostasis, that serves as an important link between metabolism and circadian clock, in part, by regulating BMAL1 activity. While the connection of REV-ERBα to the circadian clock molecular mechanism is well characterized, the interaction between mTORC1, REV-ERBα and the circadian clock machinery is not very clear. We used leucine and rapamycin to modulate mTORC1 activation and evaluate this effect on circadian rhythms. In the liver, mTORC1 was inhibited by leucine. REV-ERBα overexpression activated the mTORC1 signaling pathway via transcription inhibition of mTORC1 inhibitor, Tsc1, antagonizing the effect of leucine, while its silencing downregulated mTORC1 signaling. Activation of mTORC1 led to increased BMAL1 phosphorylation. Activation as well as inhibition of mTORC1 led to altered circadian rhythms in mouse muscle. Inhibition of liver mTORC1 by leucine or rapamycin led to low-amplitude circadian rhythms. In summary, our study shows that leucine inhibits liver mTORC1 pathway leading to dampened circadian rhythms. REV-ERBα activates the mTORC1 pathway, leading to phosphorylation of the clock protein BMAL1.",

    "issue": "267(5)",
    "pages": "455-463",
    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a major risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and complicates clinical manifestations and management of ASD significantly. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, is one of the medical conditions most commonly associated with ASD and has become an important model to examine molecular pathways associated with ASD. Previous research showed reversal of autism-like social deficits in Tsc1 +/- and Tsc2 +/- mouse models by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. However, at least 70 % of individuals with TSC also have epilepsy, known to complicate the severity and treatment responsiveness of the behavioural phenotype. No previous study has examined the impact of seizures on neurocognitive reversal by mTOR inhibitors. Adult Tsc2 +/- (Eker)-rats express social deficits similar to Tsc2 +/- mice, with additive social deficits from developmental status epilepticus (DSE). DSE was induced by intraperitoneal injection with kainic acid at post-natal days P7 and P14 (n = 12). The experimental group that modelled TSC pathology carried the Tsc2 +/- (Eker)-mutation and was challenged with DSE. The wild-type controls had not received DSE (n = 10). Four-month-old animals were analysed for social behaviour (T1), then treated three times during 1 week with 1 mg/kg everolimus and finally retested in the post-treatment behavioural analysis (T2). In the experimental group, both social interaction and social cognition were impaired at T1. After treatment at T2, behaviour in the experimental group was indistinguishable from controls. The mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, reversed social deficit behaviours in the Tsc2 haploinsufficiency plus DSE animal model to control levels.",

    "issue": "132(7)",
    "pages": "1711-7",
    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are a group of rare mesenchymal tumors that typically show both melanocytic and smooth muscle cell features. Some types of PEComa are seen at high frequency in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The TSC1 and TSC2 genes are commonly mutated in both TSC-associated and sporadic PEComas, and mTOR signaling pathway activation is also common in these tumors. Preliminary reports have indicated that the mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and related drugs have activity in some patients with non-TSC-associated PEComa. Here, we report on the use of these medications in the treatment of five consecutive patients with extrarenal nonpulmonary PEComas seen at one institution. Three complete responses, one partial response and one case of progression were seen. Molecular studies identified TSC2 aberrations in four of these patients, and TFE3 translocation was excluded in the resistant case. A review of all published cases as well as those reported here indicates that partial or complete response was seen in 6 of 11 PEComas, with 5 of 6 having a complete response. These findings highlight the consistent though incomplete activity of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of PEComas.",

    "issue": "62(3)",
    "pages": "R201-R222",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is the primary source of many pro-inflammatory cytokines in obesity. Macrophage numbers and pro-inflammatory gene expression are positively associated with adipocyte size. Free fatty acid and tumor necrosis factor-α involve in a vicious cycle between adipocytes and macrophages aggravating inflammatory changes. Thereby, M1 macrophages form a characteristic 'crown-like structure (CLS)' around necrotic adipocytes in obese adipose tissue. In obese women, CLSs of breast adipose tissue are responsible for both increase in local aromatase activity and aggressive behavior of breast cancer cells. Interlinked molecular mechanisms between adipocyte-macrophage-breast cancer cells in obesity involve seven consecutive processes: Excessive release of adipocyte- and macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines, TSC1-TSC2 complex-mTOR crosstalk, insulin resistance, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and excessive oxidative stress generation, uncoupled respiration and hypoxia, SIRT1 controversy, the increased levels of aromatase activity and estrogen production. Considering elevated risks of estrogen receptor (E2R)-positive postmenopausal breast cancer growth in obesity, adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk is important in the aforementioned issues. Increased mTORC1 signaling in obesity ensures the strong activation of oncogenic signaling in E2Rα-positive breast cancer cells. Since insulin and insulin-like growth factors have been identified as tumor promoters, hyperinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in breast cancer despite peripheral insulin resistance. The unpredictable effects of adipocyte-derived leptin-estrogen-macrophage axis, and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-adipose-resident macrophage axis in obese postmenopausal patients with breast cancer are unresolved mechanistic gaps in the molecular links between the tumor growth and adipocytokines.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy dysfunction contributes to CD4 + T cell apoptosis during sepsis leading to impairment of adaptive immunity. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway modulates CD4 + T cell survival during sepsis through mechanisms that are not fully understood. We developed a mouse model of sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to investigate dynamic changes in autophagy in CD4 + T cells. We used T cell specific-mTOR/tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1)-knockout mice to explore the roles of the mTOR pathway in modulating autophagy during sepsis. We observed reduced fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in the CD4 + T cells of CLP mice, which may represent a characteristic feature of autophagy dysfunction. Deletion of mTOR relieved autophagosome-lysosome fusion dysfunction and ameliorated apoptosis of CD4 + T cells in CLP mice, but this rescued phenotype was abolished by treatment with bafilomycin A1, a specific A-L fusion inhibitor. We further explored the underlying molecular mechanism and found that phosphorylation levels of transcription factor EB were significant higher in CLP mice and that expression of A-L fusion protein SNAREs were restricted, both of which were ameliorated by mTOR deletion. Taken together, these results suggest that the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in regulation of CD4 + T-cell apoptosis during sepsis, partly through regulation of A-L fusion-related protein transcription.",

    "pages": "10762-72",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nHyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, as a result of loss-of-function mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 genes, causes protein synthesis dysregulation, increased cell size, and aberrant neuronal connectivity. Dysregulated synthesis of synaptic proteins has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated with TSC and fragile X syndrome. However, cell type-specific translational profiles in these disease models remain to be investigated. Here, we used high-fidelity and unbiased Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) methodology to purify ribosome-associated mRNAs and identified translational alterations in a rat neuronal culture model of TSC. We find that expression of many stress and/or activity-dependent proteins is highly induced while some synaptic proteins are repressed. Importantly, transcripts for the activating transcription factor-3 (Atf3) and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (Ucp2) are highly induced in Tsc2-deficient neurons, as well as in a neuron-specific Tsc1 conditional knock-out mouse model, and show differential responses to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Gelsolin, a known target of Atf3 transcriptional activity, is also upregulated. shRNA-mediated block of Atf3 induction suppresses expression of gelsolin, an actin-severing protein, and rescues spine deficits found in Tsc2-deficient neurons. Together, our data demonstrate that a cell-autonomous program consisting of a stress-induced Atf3-gelsolin cascade affects the change in dendritic spine morphology following mTOR hyperactivation. This previously unidentified molecular cascade could be a therapeutic target for treating mTORopathies.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease associated with epilepsy and autism. Dysregulated protein synthesis has been implicated as a cause of this disease. However, cell type-specific translational profiles that are aberrant in this disease are unknown. Here we show that expression of many stress and/or activity-dependent proteins is highly induced while some synaptic proteins are repressed in neurons missing the Tsc2 gene expression. Identification of genes whose translation is abnormal in TSC may provide insights to previously unidentified therapeutic targets.",

    "issue": "69(1)",
    "pages": "79-100",
    "abstract": "Target of rapamycin (TOR) proteins are members of the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. TOR proteins integrate signals from growth factors, nutrients, stress, and cellular energy levels to control cell growth. The ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1(4EBP1) are two cellular targets of TOR kinase activity and are known to mediate TOR function in translational control in mammalian cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism of TOR regulation is not completely understood. One of the recent breakthrough studies in TOR signaling resulted in the identification of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, as negative regulators for TOR signaling. Furthermore, the discovery that the small GTPase Rheb is a direct downstream target of TSC1-TSC2 and a positive regulator of the TOR function has significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanism of TOR activation. Here we review the current understanding of the regulation of TOR signaling and discuss its function as a signaling nexus to control cell growth during normal development and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) is a cell type constantly present in a group of tumors called PEComas. PEC expresses myogenic and melanocytic markers, such as HMB45 and actin. Recently, recurrent chromosomal alterations have been demonstrated in PEC. At present, PEComa is a widely accepted entity. In the past 10 years, the use of this term has allowed to report and describe numerous cases permitting to start highlighting the biology of this group of lesions. PEComas are related to the genetic alterations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant genetic disease due to losses of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes which seem to have a role in the regulation of the Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. There are some open questions about PEComas regarding its histogenesis, the definition of epithelioid angiomyolipoma and the identification of the histological criteria of malignancy. An innovative therapeutic trial using rapamycin is under way for tumors occurring in TSC such as renal angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Its success could provide the rationale for the use of the same drug in other lesions composed of PECs, especially in the malignant ones.",

    "title": "Serine 302 Phosphorylation of Mouse Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1) Is Dispensable for Normal Insulin Signaling and Feedback Regulation by Hepatic S6 Kinase.",
    "issue": "291(16)",
    "pages": "8602-17",
    "abstract": "Constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and S6 kinase (mTORC1→ S6K) attenuates insulin-stimulated Akt activity in certain tumors in part through \"feedback\" phosphorylation of the upstream insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). However, the significance of this mechanism for regulating insulin sensitivity in normal tissue remains unclear. We investigated the function of Ser-302 in mouse IRS1, the major site of its phosphorylation by S6K in vitro, through genetic knock-in of a serine-to-alanine mutation (A302). Although insulin rapidly stimulated feedback phosphorylation of Ser-302 in mouse liver and muscle, homozygous A302 mice (A/A) and their knock-in controls (S/S) exhibited similar glucose homeostasis and muscle insulin signaling. Furthermore, both A302 and control primary hepatocytes from which Irs2 was deleted showed marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3K binding after emetine treatment to raise intracellular amino acids and activate mTORC1 → S6K signaling. To specifically activate mTORC1 in mouse tissue, we deleted hepatic Tsc1 using Cre adenovirus. Although it moderately decreased IRS1/PI3K association and Akt phosphorylation in liver, Tsc1 deletion failed to cause glucose intolerance or promote hyperinsulinemia in mixed background A/A or S/S mice. Moreover, Tsc1 deletion failed to stimulate phospho-Ser-302 or other putative S6K sites within IRS1, whereas ribosomal S6 protein was constitutively phosphorylated. Following acute Tsc1 deletion from hepatocytes, Akt phosphorylation, but not IRS1/PI3K association, was rapidly restored by treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Thus, within the hepatic compartment, mTORC1 → S6K signaling regulates Akt largely through IRS-independent means with little effect upon physiologic insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The qRT-PCR analysis of 139 clinical samples and analysis of 150 on-line database clinical samples indicated that AKT3 mRNA expression level was elevated in primary prostate tumors. Immunohistochemical staining of 65 clinical samples revealed that AKT3 protein expression was higher in prostate tumors of stage I, II, III as compared to nearby normal tissues. Plasmid overexpression of AKT3 promoted cell proliferation of LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, and CA-HPV-10 human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, while knockdown of AKT3 by siRNA reduced cell proliferation. Overexpression of AKT3 increased the protein expression of total AKT, phospho-AKT S473, phospho-AKT T308, B-Raf, c-Myc, Skp2, cyclin E, GSK3β, phospho-GSK3β S9, phospho-mTOR S2448, and phospho-p70S6K T421/S424, but decreased TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1) and TSC2 (tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2) proteins in PC-3 PCa cells. Overexpression of AKT3 also increased protein abundance of phospho-AKT S473, phospho-AKT T308, and B-Raf but decreased expression of TSC1 and TSC2 proteins in LNCaP, DU-145, and CA-HPV-10 PCa cells. Oncomine datasets analysis suggested that AKT3 mRNA level was positively correlated to BRAF. Knockdown of AKT3 in DU-145 cells with siRNA increased the sensitivity of DU-145 cells to B-Raf inhibitor treatment. Knockdown of TSC1 or TSC2 promoted the proliferation of PCa cells. Our observations implied that AKT3 may be a potential therapeutic target for PCa treatment.",

    "pages": "94-98",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is one of the most common genetic causes of epilepsy. Mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes lead to the dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This mTOR pathway hyperactivation is associated with several processes resulting in epileptic conditions. The occurrence of seizures and their treatment outcomes seem to play a crucial role in cognitive and behavioral developments in patients with TSC. Mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors have been proven to be effective in epilepsy treatment in individuals with TSC. Specifically, because of their disease-modifying mechanism of action, they have the capability to prevent epileptogenesis in patients with TSC. This article will provide an overview of the current evidence of and delineate future perspectives for mTOR inhibitors and their role in preventing epileptogenesis.",

    "pages": "4532-4544",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe phosphatidyl 3-inositol kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway frequently is activated in patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC). In the current study, the authors performed a phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of the pan-isoform class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic UC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo cohorts were recruited: an initial genetically unselected cohort and a subsequent expansion cohort of patients with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-altered tumors. The primary endpoint was the 2-month progression-free survival rate. A rate of ≥80% was considered promising using a Simon 2-stage minimax design. Secondary endpoints included safety and correlation of markers of PI3K pathway activation with outcome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix of 13 evaluable patients within the initial cohort demonstrated stable disease and 1 demonstrated a partial response, which was below the cutoff of 9 patients required to proceed to stage 2. Three of the patients with stable disease and the patient with a partial response harbored somatic TSC1 alterations. Four patients subsequently were recruited onto an expansion cohort: 3 patients with TSC1 alterations and 1 patient with a PIK3CA-activating mutation. No patient achieved disease control at 8 weeks and accrual was halted. Of the 19 patients evaluable for toxicity, 17 demonstrated treatment-related toxicities, 2 of whom had to discontinue therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBuparlisib was found to demonstrate modest activity in patients with metastatic UC whose tumors harbored TSC1 loss of function alterations; however, this was not a robust predictor of response to buparlisib. The pattern of genetic coalterations likely influences drug sensitivity. Given the modest clinical activity and substantial toxicity of buparlisib, future trials of PI3K inhibitors in patients with UC should focus on isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in genomically selected patients.\n\n\nLAY SUMMARY\nThe phosphatidyl 3-inositol kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway frequently is upregulated in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). This trial explored buparlisib, an inhibitor of the pathway, in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic UC. Although the drug was found to have modest efficacy, with 6 patients experiencing stable disease and 1 patient achieving a partial response at 8 weeks on therapy, significant side effects also were observed. Patients with specific genetic alterations responded to treatment. Further studies of PI3K pathway inhibition are warranted using newer agents that have superior toxicity profiles and are more selective inhibitors of the pathway.",

    "issue": "1864(1)",
    "pages": "62-75",
    "abstract": "The cochaperone BAG3 is a central protein homeostasis factor in mechanically strained mammalian cells. It mediates the degradation of unfolded and damaged forms of the actin-crosslinker filamin through chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA). In addition, BAG3 stimulates filamin transcription in order to compensate autophagic disposal and to maintain the actin cytoskeleton under strain. Here we demonstrate that BAG3 coordinates protein synthesis and autophagy through spatial regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The cochaperone utilizes its WW domain to contact a proline-rich motif in the tuberous sclerosis protein TSC1 that functions as an mTORC1 inhibitor in association with TSC2. Interaction with BAG3 results in a recruitment of TSC complexes to actin stress fibers, where the complexes act on a subpopulation of mTOR-positive vesicles associated with the cytoskeleton. Local inhibition of mTORC1 is essential to initiate autophagy at sites of filamin unfolding and damage. At the same time, BAG3-mediated sequestration of TSC1/TSC2 relieves mTORC1 inhibition in the remaining cytoplasm, which stimulates protein translation. In human muscle, an exercise-induced association of TSC1 with the cytoskeleton coincides with mTORC1 activation in the cytoplasm. The spatial regulation of mTORC1 exerted by BAG3 apparently provides the basis for a simultaneous induction of autophagy and protein synthesis to maintain the proteome under mechanical strain.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by dominant mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes is characterized by the presence of brain malformations, the cortical tubers that are thought to contribute to the generation of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Here we report that tuberless heterozygote Tsc1(+/-) mice show functional upregulation of cortical GluN2C-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in an mTOR-dependent manner and exhibit recurrent, unprovoked seizures during early postnatal life (<P19). Seizures are generated intracortically in the granular layer of the neocortex. Slow kinetics of aberrant GluN2C-mediated currents in spiny stellate cells promotes excessive temporal integration of persistent NMDAR-mediated recurrent excitation and seizure generation. Accordingly, specific GluN2C/D antagonists block seizures in Tsc1(+/-) mice in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, GluN2C expression is upregulated in TSC human surgical resections, and a GluN2C/D antagonist reduces paroxysmal hyperexcitability. Thus, GluN2C receptor constitutes a promising molecular target to treat epilepsy in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "The Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway controls several aspects of neuronal development. Mutations in regulators of mTORC1, such as Tsc1 and Tsc2, lead to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism, intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. The correct development of inhibitory interneurons is crucial for functional circuits. In particular, the axonal arborisation and synapse density of parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons change in the postnatal brain. How and whether mTORC1 signaling affects PV cell development is unknown. Here, we show that Tsc1 haploinsufficiency causes a premature increase in terminal axonal branching and bouton density formed by mutant PV cells, followed by a loss of perisomatic innervation in adult mice. PV cell-restricted Tsc1 haploinsufficient and knockout mice show deficits in social behavior. Finally, we identify a sensitive period during the third postnatal week during which treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin rescues deficits in both PV cell innervation and social behavior in adult conditional haploinsufficient mice. Our findings reveal a role of mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of the developmental time course and maintenance of cortical PV cell connectivity and support a mechanistic basis for the targeted rescue of autism-related behaviors in disorders associated with deregulated mTORC1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIB is a malformation of cortical development characterized by presence of balloon cells. These cells share phenotypic features of giant cells found in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but the relationship between FCD type IIB and TSC is not well established. TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutation in either of two genes: TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin. Both proteins form a complex inhibiting mTOR signalling pathway and thus regulate cell size and proliferation. In this study, tuberin and hamartin expression was evaluated under a confocal microscope in six cases of Taylor's balloon cell type FCD. Three patients met the clinical criteria for TSC. In three other patients, TSC was excluded based on a panel of clinical and radiological examinations. Additionally, two cases of FCD type I and 3 samples of normal brain tissue were used as a reference group. We found loss of tuberin and hamartin expression in FCD type IIB lesions from patients with TSC. In sporadic FCD type IIB cases, only a few tuberin and hamartin positive cells were detected in the white-grey matter junction and in deeper parts of the white matter. Cortical balloon cells showed loss of both tuberin and hamartin. In contrast, the expression of tuberin and hamartin in FCD type I samples was strong, similarly to normal brain tissue. In conclusion, loss of TSC1 and TSC2 products expression in balloon cells of both cortical dysplasia type IIB in TSC-related and sporadic patients suggests that FCD type IIB may represent the focal form of TSC.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and devastating condition for which no curative treatment is available. Exaggerated lung cell senescence may be a major pathogenic factor. Here, we investigated the potential role for mTOR signaling in lung cell senescence and alterations in COPD using lung tissue and derived cultured cells from patients with COPD and from age- and sex-matched control smokers. Cell senescence in COPD was linked to mTOR activation, and mTOR inhibition by low-dose rapamycin prevented cell senescence and inhibited the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype. To explore whether mTOR activation was a causal pathogenic factor, we developed transgenic mice exhibiting mTOR overactivity in lung vascular cells or alveolar epithelial cells. In this model, mTOR activation was sufficient to induce lung cell senescence and to mimic COPD lung alterations, with the rapid development of lung emphysema, pulmonary hypertension, and inflammation. These findings support a causal relationship between mTOR activation, lung cell senescence, and lung alterations in COPD, thereby identifying the mTOR pathway as a potentially new therapeutic target in COPD.",

    "abstract": "Downregulation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) can extend lifespan in multiple species, including mice. Growth hormone receptor knockout mice (GHRKO) and Snell dwarf mice have 40% or greater lifespan increase, and have lower mTORC1 function, which might reflect alteration in mTORC1 components or alteration of upstream proteins that modulate mTOR activity. Here we report reduction of mTORC components DEPTOR and PRAS40 in liver of these long-lived mice; these changes are opposite in direction to those that would be expected to lead to lower mTORC1 function. In contrast, levels of the upstream regulators TSC1 and TSC2 are elevated in GHRKO and Snell liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, and the ratio of phosphorylated TSC2 to total TSC2 is lower in the tissues of the long-lived mutant mice. In addition, knocking down TSC2 in GHRKO fibroblasts reversed the effects of the GHRKO mutation on mTORC1 function. Thus increased amounts of unphosphorylated, active, inhibitory TSC may contribute to lower mTORC1 function in these mice.",

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the TSC1/TSC2 complex (TSC1/2) cause tuberous sclerosis (TSC), a hereditary syndrome with neurological symptoms and benign hamartoma tumours in the brain. Since TSC effectors are largely unknown in the human brain, TSC patient cortical tubers were used to uncover hyperphosphorylation unique to TSC primary astrocytes, the cell type affected in the brain. We found abnormal hyperphosphorylation of catenin delta-1 S268, which was reversible by mTOR-specific inhibitors. In contrast, in three metastatic astrocytoma cell lines, S268 was under phosphorylated, suggesting S268 phosphorylation controls metastasis. TSC astrocytes appeared epithelial (i.e. tightly adherent, less motile, and epithelial (E)-cadherin positive), whereas wild-type astrocytes were mesenchymal (i.e. E-cadherin negative and highly motile). Despite their epithelial phenotype, TSC astrocytes outgrew contact inhibition, and monolayers sporadically generated tuberous foci, a phenotype blocked by the mTOR inhibitor, Torin1. Also, mTOR-regulated phosphokinase C epsilon (PKCe) activity induced phosphorylation of catenin delta-1 S268, which in turn mediated cell-cell adhesion in astrocytes. The mTOR-dependent, epithelial phenotype of TSC astrocytes suggests TSC1/2 and mTOR tune the phosphorylation level of catenin delta-1 by controlling PKCe activity, thereby regulating the mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET). Thus, some forms of TSC could be treated with PKCe inhibitors, while metastasis of astrocytomas might be blocked by PKCe stimulators.",

    "issue": "457(4)",

    "abstract": "The genetic disease tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss of function mutations in either TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin), which serve as negative regulators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. TSC patients exhibit developmental brain abnormalities and tuber formations that are associated with neuropsychological and neurocognitive impairments, seizures and premature death. Mechanistically, TSC1 and TSC2 loss of function mutations result in abnormally high mTORC1 activity. Thus, the development of a strategy to inhibit abnormally high mTORC1 activity may have therapeutic value in the treatment of TSC. mTORC1 is a master regulator of growth processes, and its activity can be reduced by withdrawal of growth factors, decreased energy availability, and by the immunosuppressant rapamycin. Recently, glutamine has been shown to alter mTORC1 activity in a TSC1-TSC2 independent manner in cells cultured under amino acid- and serum-deprived conditions. Since starvation culture conditions are not physiologically relevant, we examined if glutamine can regulate mTORC1 in non-deprived cells and in a murine model of TSC. Our results show that glutamine can reduce phosphorylation of S6 and S6 kinase, surrogate indicators of mTORC1 activity, in both deprived and non-deprived cells, although higher concentrations were required for non-deprived cultures. When administered orally to TSC2 knockout mice, glutamine reduced S6 phosphorylation in the brain and significantly prolonged their lifespan. Taken together, these results suggest that glutamine supplementation can be used as a potential treatment for TSC.",

The tumor size, age of the patients, mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, indication for the surgery, and postsurgical complications were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of patients at surgery was 9.7 years. Mean follow-up after surgery was 63.7 months. Thirty-seven (57.8%) tumors were symptomatic and 27 (42.2%) were asymptomatic. Patients with TSC2 mutations developed subependymal giant cell astrocytoma at a significantly younger age than individuals with TSC1 mutations. Four patients (6.2% of all surgeries) died after surgery. Surgery-related complications were reported in 0%, 46%, 83%, 81%, and 67% of patients with tumors <2 cm, between 2 and 3 cm, between 3 and 4 cm, >4 cm, and bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, respectively, and were most common in children younger than 3 years of age. The most common complications included hemiparesis, hydrocephalus, hematoma, and cognitive decline.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study indicates that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma surgery is associated with significant risk in individuals with bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, tumors bigger than 2 cm, and in children younger than 3 years of age. Therefore, tuberous sclerosis complex patients should be thoroughly screened for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma growth, and early treatment should be considered in selected patients.",

    "issue": "10(3)",
    "pages": "305-15",
    "abstract": "Resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy is responsible for therapeutic failure of many common human cancers including cancer of head and neck (HNC). Mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remain unclear. In this study, we identified neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL) as a novel hypermethylated gene associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in HNC. Analysis of 14 HNC cell lines revealed that downregulation of NEFL expression significantly correlated with increased resistance to cisplatin. Hypermethylation of NEFL promoter CpG islands was observed in cell lines as examined by bisulfite DNA sequencing and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and tightly correlated with reduced NEFL mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, in patient samples with HNC (n = 51) analyzed by quantitative MSP, NEFL promoter hypermethylation was associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy [relative risk (RR), 3.045; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.459-6.355; P = 0.007] and predicted diminished overall and disease-free survival for patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Knockdown of NEFL by siRNA in the highly cisplatin-sensitive cell line PCI13 increased (P < 0.01) resistance to cisplatin. In cisplatin-resistant O11 and SCC25cp cells, restored expression of NEFL significantly increased sensitivity to the drug. Furthermore, NEFL physically associated with tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), a known inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, and NEFL downregulation led to functional activation of mTOR pathway and consequentially conferred cisplatin resistance. This is the first study to show a role for NEFL in HNC chemoresistance. Our findings suggest that NEFL methylation is a novel mechanism for HNC chemoresistance and may represent a candidate biomarker predictive of chemotherapeutic response and survival in patients with HNC.",

    "issue": "5()",
    "pages": "22",
    "abstract": "Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a recently described, indolent vascular tumor that usually presents in the distal extremities. PMH typically has a multi-focal presentation and can involve several tissue planes including the dermis, subcutis, muscle, and bone. This soft tissue tumor predominantly affects men between 20 and 50 years of age. PMH tumors typically are resected but frequently recur locally; thus, more efficacious treatment options are needed. Herein, we report two cases of patients with PMH who were treated with systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to describe a response of PMH either to gemcitabine/taxane cytotoxic chemotherapy or to a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. In the first case, a 45-year-old man with PMH of the right ilium was treated with gemcitabine plus docetaxel. Although chemotherapy was ultimately halted owing to gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity, positron emission tomography-computer tomography scans taken after three cycles of gemcitabine plus docetaxel illustrated a noticeable response to the regimen. In the second case, a 22-year-old man with PMH of the right distal femur and metastases in the left ilium showed no response to gemcitabine plus docetaxel therapy, but underwent surgical resection after cisplatin and doxorubicin resulted in stable disease. DNA sequencing of his tumor revealed the presence of a tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) mutation, so daily everolimus, which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin, was started. Two months after beginning everolimus, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis, which revealed mild shrinkage of PMH metastases in the left iliac bone. Despite the apparent heterogeneity of response to gemcitabine/taxane chemotherapy in our two patients, these two cases indicate that gemcitabine/taxane and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may serve as systemic treatment options for PMH and warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nALPPS procedure has been introduced to increase the volume of future liver remnant. The mechanisms underlying the accelerated regeneration observed with ALPPS are unknown. It was hypothesized that AMPK/mTOR is activated as an integrating pathway for metabolic signals leading to proliferation and cell growth. Our aim was to analyze increase in liver volume, proliferation parameters and expression of AMPK/mTOR pathway-related molecules in patients undergoing ALPPS.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA single center prospective study of patients undergoing ALPPS was performed from 2013 to 2015. Liver and serum samples, clinical laboratory results and CT-scan data were obtained. ELISA, Ki-67 immunostaining and qRT-PCR were performed in deportalized and remnant liver tissue in both stages of the procedure.\n\n\nRESULTS\n11 patients were enrolled. Remnant liver volume increased 112 ± 63% (p < 0.05) in 9.1 ± 1.6 days. Proliferation-related cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, HGF and EGF significantly increased, while higher Ki-67 immunostaining and cyclin D expression were observed in remnant livers after ALPPS. mTOR, S6K1, 4E-BP1, TSC1 and TSC2 expression were significantly increased in remnant livers at second stage, while AMPK and Akt increased only in deportalized liver samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRapid liver regeneration with ALPPS might be associated with hepatocyte proliferation induced by mTOR pathway activation.",

    "pages": "1654-1663",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by germline inactivating mutations of TSC1 or TSC2. In TSC-associated tumors of the brain, heart, skin, kidney and lung, inactivation of both alleles of TSC1 or TSC2 leads to hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway. The TSC/mTORC1 pathway is a key regulator of cellular processes related to growth, proliferation and autophagy. We and others have previously found that mTORC1 regulates microRNA biogenesis, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Microprocessor, a multi-protein complex including the nuclease Drosha, processes the primary miR transcript. Using a dual-luciferase reporter, we found that inhibition of mTORC1 or downregulation of Raptor decreased Microprocessor activity, while loss of TSC2 led to a striking increase (∼5-fold) in Microprocessor activity. To determine the global impact of TSC2 on microRNAs we quantitatively analyzed 752 microRNAs in Tsc2-expressing and Tsc2-deficient cells. Out of 259 microRNAs expressed in both cell lines, 137 were significantly upregulated and 24 were significantly downregulated in Tsc2-deficient cells, consistent with the increased Microprocessor activity. Microprocessor activity is known to be regulated in part by GSK3β. We found that total GSK3β levels were higher in Tsc2-deficient cells, and the increase in Microprocessor activity associated with Tsc2 loss was reversed by three different GSK3β inhibitors. Furthermore, mTOR inhibition increased the levels of phospho-GSK3β (S9), which negatively affects Microprocessor activity. Taken together these data reveal that TSC2 regulates microRNA biogenesis and Microprocessor activity via GSK3β.",

    "pages": "379-390",
    "abstract": "Background Cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) hippocampal neurons are resistant to global ischemia, whereas cornu ammonis (CA1) 1 neurons are vulnerable. Hamartin expression in CA3 neurons mediates this endogenous resistance via productive autophagy. Neurons lacking hamartin demonstrate exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased cell death. We investigated endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in CA1 and CA3 regions following global cerebral ischemia, and whether pharmacological modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress or autophagy altered neuronal viability . Methods In vivo: male Wistar rats underwent sham or 10 min of transient global cerebral ischemia. CA1 and CA3 areas were microdissected and endoplasmic reticulum stress protein expression quantified at 3 h and 12 h of reperfusion. In vitro: primary neuronal cultures (E18 Wistar rat embryos) were exposed to 2 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation or normoxia in the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer (thapsigargin or tunicamycin), an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor (salubrinal or 4-phenylbutyric acid), an autophagy inducer ([4'-(N-diethylamino) butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine (10-NCP)) or autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine). Results In vivo, decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress protein expression (phospho-eIF2α and ATF4) was observed at 3 h of reperfusion in CA3 neurons following ischemia, and increased in CA1 neurons at 12 h of reperfusion. In vitro, endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers and high doses of the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitors also increased cell death. Both induction and inhibition of autophagy also increased cell death. Conclusion Endoplasmic reticulum stress is associated with neuronal cell death following ischemia. Neither reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress nor induction of autophagy demonstrated neuroprotection in vitro, highlighting their complex role in neuronal biology following ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TS), neurological disorder manifesting with the formation of tumors in numerous organ systems, is a disease associated with the upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. It has been found that in healthy individuals two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2, encoding proteins called hamartin and tuberin, respectively, are responsible for the control over mTOR kinase. Loss of one of these genes constitutes the genetic background of TS. In the current study, we aimed at evaluating the fitness of the only TS-associated sarcoma cell line deposited in American Tissue Culture Collection, TSC2ang1, for the in vitro studies on TS. We found that the line shows a stable chromosome pattern with typical Robertsonian translocations. Similarly to primary tumors from TS patients, TSC2ang1 cells respond to rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition. The cells demonstrate activation of both Akt and Erk pathways, but inhibition of neither of them is as effective as mTOR suppression when considering proliferation potential. Based on these results we propose TSC2ang1 as a good and stable model for pathophysiological and pharmacological studies on skin lesions in TS.",

    "abstract": "The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins, which function as a TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, are associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle-like cells in the lungs. The precise molecular mechanisms that modulate LAM cell growth remain unknown. We demonstrate that TSC2 regulates LAM cell growth. Cells dissociated from LAM nodules from the lungs of five different patients with LAM have constitutively activated S6K1, hyperphosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, activated Erk, and increased DNA synthesis compared with normal cells from the same patients. These effects were augmented by PDGF stimulation. Akt activity was unchanged in LAM cells. Rapamycin, a specific S6K1 inhibitor, abolished increased LAM cell growth. The full-length TSC2 was necessary for inhibition of S6 hyperphosphorylation and DNA synthesis in LAM cells, as demonstrated by co-microinjection of the C-terminus, which contains the GTPase activating protein homology domain, and the N-terminus, which binds TSC1. Our data demonstrate that increased LAM cell growth is associated with constitutive S6K1 activation, which is extinguishable by TSC2 expression. Loss of TSC2 GAP activity or disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex dysregulates S6K1 activation, which leads to abnormal cell proliferation associated with LAM disease.",

    "pages": "282-94",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disease associated with an overall reduction in life expectancy due to the possible occurrence of different life-threatening conditions. Subjects affected by TSC are, in fact, at risk of hydrocephalus secondary to the growth of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, or of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Other nonneurological life-threatening conditions include abdominal bleeding owing to renal angiomyolipomas rupture, renal insufficiency due to progressive parenchymal destruction by multiple cysts, pulmonary complications due to lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and cardiac failure or arrhythmias secondary to rhabdomyomas. In the last decades, there has been a great progress in understanding the pathophysiology of TSC-related manifestations, which are mainly linked to the hyperactivation of the so-called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, as a consequence of the mutation in 1 of the 2 genes TSC1 or TSC2. This led to the development of new treatment strategies for this disease. In fact, it is now available as a biologically targeted therapy with everolimus, a selective mTOR inhibitor, which has been licensed in Europe and USA for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and angiomyolipomas in subjects with TSC. This drug also proved to benefit other TSC-related manifestations, including pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and presumably epileptic seizures. mTOR inhibitors are thus proving to be a systemic therapy able to simultaneously address different and potentially life-threatening complications, giving the hope of improving life expectation in individuals with TSC.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis shows certain genetic alterations which are not found in the endometrium of disease-free women. The aim of the study was to compare the expression level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) tumor suppressor and oncogene-related genes in the endometrium of women with and without endometriosis as well as in ovarian endometriosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 81 regularly menstruating patients were recruited in the study. We applied the micro fluidic gene array to examine the expression of 15 human tumor suppressor and oncogenes in eutopic endometrium of 40 women with endometriosis and 41 controls without endometriosis. In 14 patients with endometriosis, gene expression was also studied in matched ovarian lesions. We studied the following genes: NF1, RHEB, mTOR, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, KRAS, S6K1, TP53, EIF4E, LKB1, PIK3CA, BECN1, 4EBP1 and AKT1. Immunohistochemical studies were subsequently performed for selected proteins.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 15 studied genes, we found significantly higher levels of oncogene AKT1 (P = 0.006) and tumor suppressor gene 4EBP1 (P = 0.01) mRNAs in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared with control patients. Immunohistochemistry showed that 4EBP1 and AKT1 proteins were expressed in eutopic endometrium.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that up-regulation of AKT1 and 4EBP1 in eutopic endometrium may be associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but their precise role remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "Myelination is a biosynthetically demanding process in which mTORC1, the gatekeeper of anabolism, occupies a privileged regulatory position. We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.",

    "abstract": "The TSC/Rheb/TOR signaling pathway plays important roles in growth and cell cycle regulation. The main player TOR belongs to the PI3K-related protein kinase family. Recent studies utilizing fission yeast Tor2 have led to the identification of a number of amino acid changes that lead to inactivation as well as activation of TOR kinase. Also, constitutive active mutations in its upstream regulator, Rheb, have been identified. Isolation and characterization of temperature sensitive Tor2 mutants have established that this kinase functions as a key switch that determines cell fate between growth and sexual development. Introduction of Tor2 activating mutations into mTOR conferred nutrient independent activation of mTOR. Interestingly, these studies point to regions of TOR kinase important for its function.",

Activation of IKKβ and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Erk1/2 and p38 has been suggested to link inflammation and cellular stress to activation of mTORC1 through the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) complex. Consequently, activation of these proteins constitutes potential alternative mechanisms of mTORC1 activation following exercise. Previously, we demonstrated that mTOR is preferentially activated in response to resistance exercise compared to endurance exercise in trained individuals without concomitant activation of Akt. In the present study, we extended this investigation by examining IκB kinase complex (IKK), TSC1, MAPK, and upstream Akt activators, along with gene expression of selected cytokines, in skeletal muscles from these subjects. Biopsies were sampled prior to, immediately after, and in the recovery period following resistance exercise, endurance exercise, and control interventions. The major finding was that IKKβ phosphorylation increased exclusively after resistance exercise. No changes in TSC1, Erk1/2, insulin receptor, or insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation were observed in any of the groups, while p38 phosphorylation was higher in the resistance exercise group compared to both other groups immediately after the intervention. Resistance and endurance exercise increased IL6, IL8, and TNFα gene expression immediately after exercise. The non-exercise control group demonstrated that cytokine gene expression is also sensitive to repeated biopsy sampling, whereas no effect of repeated biopsy sampling on protein expression and phosphorylation was observed. In conclusion, resistance exercise, but not endurance exercise, increases IKKβ phosphorylation in trained human subjects, which support the idea that IKKβ can influence the activation of mTORC1 in human skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nEpithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML) is a rare variant of renal angiomyolipoma with malignant potential, and the cytogenetic and clinical behavior of EAML remains a challenging issue.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyze the clinical courses of five EAML, the use of everolimus on metastatic EAML, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies to investigate the gene mutation of TSC and the impact of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in metastatic EAML.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age was 37.8 years, mean tumor size was 13 cm, all patients received radical nephrectomy, one stage IV patient received neoadjuvant mTOR inhibitor management, and one patient with high mitotic activity developed metastasis 1 year after nephrectomy. NGS assay showed a frameshift gene mutation of TSC2 in chromosome 16. PCR array for the mRNA alterations in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway of EAML showed high expression of PIP3, AKT, TSC1, mTOR, PDK1, P70, 4E-BP1 and elF4E.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEAML of the kidney is a specific type of renal AML with malignant potentials, where around 22% of the patients present with invasion or metastasis. Higher mitotic activities indicate a greater metastatic potential, with radical nephrectomy as the treatment of choice, and mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus either as neoadjuvant or adjuvant targeted therapy can lead to a better clinical outcome. NGS to explore the mTOR signaling pathway may help us to better understand the pathogenesis and progression of EAML.",

    "abstract": "Functional inactivation of tuberous sclerosis 2 gene (Tsc2) leads to renal carcinogenesis in the hereditary renal carcinoma Eker rat models. Recent studies revealed a role of tuberin, a TSC2 product, in suppressing the p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) activity via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Phosphorylated S6 protein, a substrate of p70S6K, was expressed in the early lesions in Eker rats, and this expression was suppressed by the treatment of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. We previously isolated the novel gene Niban expressed in renal carcinogenesis of Eker rats. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of Niban was detected from early preneoplastic lesions in Eker rats. Interestingly, in contrast to the phosphorylated S6 protein, the expression of Niban was unchanged and early lesions still remained even after treatment with rapamycin. These results might suggest the existence of another pathway independent of mTOR-S6K pathway in Tsc2 mutant renal carcinogenesis. In addition, Niban was also expressed in other renal carcinoma models, including Tsc1 and Tsc2 knockout mice, and various types of human renal cell carcinomas. Thus, Niban was commonly expressed in renal carcinomas and might be a new marker for renal carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 or TSC2 mutations cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and lead to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) hyperactivation evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4-elongation factor binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Amino acid (AA) levels modulate mTOR-dependent S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in non-neural cells, but this has not been comprehensively investigated in neurons. The effects of AA levels on mTOR signaling and S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were analyzed in Tsc2 and Depdc5 (a distinct mTOR regulatory gene associated with epilepsy) CRISPR-edited Neuro2a (N2a) cells and differentiated neurons. Tsc2 or Depdc5 knockout (KO) led to S6 and 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation and cell soma enlargement, but while Tsc2 KO N2a cells exhibited reduced S6 phosphorylation (Ser240/244) and cell soma size after incubation in AA free (AAF) media, Depdc5 KO cells did not. Using a CFP/YFP FRET-biosensor coupled to 4E-BP1, we assayed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in living N2a cells and differentiated neurons following Tsc2 or Depdc5 KO. AAF conditions reduced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in Tsc2 KO N2a cells but had no effect in Depdc5 KO cells. Rapamycin blocked S6 protein phosphorylation but had no effect on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, following either Tsc2 or Depdc5 KO. Confocal imaging demonstrated that AAF media promoted movement of mTOR off the lysosome, functionally inactivating mTOR, in Tsc2 KO but not Depdc5 KO cells, demonstrating that AA levels modulate lysosomal mTOR localization and account, in part, for differential effects of AAF conditions following Tsc2 versus Depdc5 KO. AA levels and rapamycin differentially modulate S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and mTOR lysosomal localization in neurons following Tsc2 KO versus Depdc5 KO. Neuronal mTOR signaling in mTOR-associated epilepsies may have distinct responses to mTOR inhibitors and to levels of cellular amino acids.",

We explored whether expression of MTOR pathway components has prognostic significance in NET patients.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe evaluated immunohistochemical expression of MTOR and phospho (p) -MTOR; its downstream targets RPS6KB1, RPS6, and EIF4EBP1; and its upstream regulators, in a cohort of 195 archival neuroendocrine tumors. We correlated expression levels with clinical outcomes, after adjusting for other prognostic variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed anticipated correlations between expression of upstream components of the MTOR pathway and their downstream targets. Expression of PIK3CA, MTOR, or p-EIF4EBP1 was associated with high MKI67 (Ki-67) labeling index. We failed to identify clinical correlations associated with expression of the upstream regulators TSC1, TSC2, AKT, p-AKT, PDPK1, PTEN, PIK3R1, or PIK3CA. In contrast, high expression of MTOR or its activated downstream targets p-RPS6KB1, p-RPS6, or p-EIF4EBP1 was associated with adverse clinical outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur observations suggest that expression of MTOR or its downstream targets may be adverse prognostic factors in neuroendocrine tumors.",

    "issue": "120(1)",
    "pages": "103-14",
    "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase/PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is frequently altered in cancer, but the underlying mechanism leading to tumorigenesis by activated mTOR remains less clear. Here we show that mTOR is a positive regulator of Notch signaling in mouse and human cells, acting through induction of the STAT3/p63/Jagged signaling cascade. Furthermore, in response to differential cues from mTOR, we found that Notch served as a molecular switch to shift the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. We determined that hyperactive mTOR signaling impaired cell differentiation of murine embryonic fibroblasts via potentiation of Notch signaling. Elevated mTOR signaling strongly correlated with enhanced Notch signaling in poorly differentiated but not in well-differentiated human breast cancers. Both human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and mouse kidney tumors with hyperactive mTOR due to tumor suppressor TSC1 or TSC2 deficiency exhibited enhanced STAT3/p63/Notch signaling. Furthermore, tumorigenic potential of cells with uncontrolled mTOR signaling was suppressed by Notch inhibition. Our data therefore suggest that perturbation of cell differentiation by augmented Notch signaling might be responsible for the underdifferentiated phenotype displayed by certain tumors with an aberrantly activated RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Additionally, the STAT3/p63/Notch axis may be a useful target for the treatment of cancers exhibiting hyperactive mTOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and mTOR signaling is important in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Recent studies using oocyte- and granulosa cell-specific deletion of mTOR inhibitor genes TSC1 or TSC2 demonstrated the important role of mTOR signaling in the promotion of ovarian follicle development. We now report that treatment of ovaries from juvenile mice with an mTOR activator MHY1485 stimulated mTOR, S6K1 and rpS6 phosphorylation. Culturing ovaries for 4 days with MHY1485 increased ovarian explant weights and follicle development. In vivo studies further demonstrated that pre-incubation of these ovaries with MHY1485 for 2 days, followed by allo-grafting into kidney capsules of adult ovariectomized hosts for 5 days, led to marked increases in graft weights and promotion of follicle development. Mature oocytes derived from MHY1485-activated ovarian grafts could be successfully fertilized, leading the delivery of healthy pups. We further treated ovaries with the mTOR activator together with AKT activators (PTEN inhibitor and phosphoinositol-3-kinase stimulator) before grafting and found additive enhancement of follicle growth. Our studies demonstrate the ability of an mTOR activator in promoting follicle growth, leading to a potential strategy to stimulate preantral follicle growth in infertile patients.",

    "title": "Hyperactivation of mTORC1 disrupts cellular homeostasis in cerebellar Purkinje cells.",
    "issue": "9(1)",
    "pages": "2799",
    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cellular metabolism. The importance of mTORC1 signaling in neuronal development and functions has been highlighted by its strong relationship with many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Previous studies demonstrated that hyperactivation of mTORC1 in forebrain recapitulates tuberous sclerosis and neurodegeneration. In the mouse cerebellum, Purkinje cell-specific knockout of Tsc1/2 has been implicated in autistic-like behaviors. However, since TSC1/2 activity does not always correlate with clinical manifestations as evident in some cases of tuberous sclerosis, the intriguing possibility is raised that phenotypes observed in Tsc1/2 knockout mice cannot be attributable solely to mTORC1 hyperactivation. Here we generated transgenic mice in which mTORC1 signaling is directly hyperactivated in Purkinje cells. The transgenic mice exhibited impaired synapse elimination of climbing fibers and motor discoordination without affecting social behaviors. Furthermore, mTORC1 hyperactivation induced prominent apoptosis of Purkinje cells, accompanied with dysregulated cellular homeostasis including cell enlargement, increased mitochondrial respiratory activity, and activation of pseudohypoxic response. These findings suggest the different contributions between hyperactivated mTORC1 and Tsc1/2 knockout in social behaviors, and reveal the perturbations of cellular homeostasis by hyperactivated mTORC1 as possible underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunctions and death in tuberous sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "issue": "257(1)",
    "pages": "109-124",
    "abstract": "Angiosarcomas are aggressive vascular sarcomas that arise from endothelial cells and have an extremely poor prognosis. Because of the rarity of angiosarcomas, knowledge of molecular drivers and optimized treatment strategies is lacking, highlighting the need for in vivo models to study the disease. Previously, we generated genetically engineered mouse models of angiosarcoma driven by aP2-Cre-mediated biallelic loss of Dicer1 or conditional activation of KrasG12D with Cdkn2a loss that histologically and genetically resemble human tumors. In the present study, we found that DICER1 functions as a potent tumor suppressor and its deletion, in combination with either KRASG12D expression or Cdkn2a loss, is associated with angiosarcoma development. Independent of the genetic driver, the mTOR pathway was activated in all murine angiosarcoma models. Direct activation of the mTOR pathway by conditional deletion of Tsc1 with aP2-Cre resulted in tumors that resemble intermediate grade human kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas, indicating that mTOR activation was not sufficient to drive the malignant angiosarcoma phenotype. Genetic dissection of the spectrum of vascular tumors identified genes specifically regulated in the aggressive murine angiosarcomas that are also enriched in human angiosarcoma. The genetic dissection driving the transition across the malignant spectrum of endothelial sarcomas provides an opportunity to identify key determinants of the malignant phenotype, novel therapies for angiosarcoma, and novel in vivo models to further explore angiosarcoma pathogenesis. © 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Nesfatin-1, an 82 amino acid gastric peptide, is involved in regulation of food uptake and in multiple metabolic activities. Whether nesfatin-1 modulates the differentiation and lipid metabolism of brown adipocytes remains unknown. In the present study, we found that nesfatin-1 mRNA and protein were detectable in isolated brown adipocytes and gradually decreased during differentiation (95% CI 0.6057 to 1.034, p = 0.0001). The decrease in nesfatin-1 was associated with a significant reduction in p-S6. Exposure to nesfatin-1 promoted differentiation of brown adipocytes as revealed by a significant increase in UCP1 mRNA (p = 0.03) and lipolysis-related ATGL mRNA (p = 0.04). Nesfatin-1 attenuated phosphorylation of S6K and S6 during brown adipocyte differentiation. Activation of mTOR by leucine or deletion of TSC1 decreased expression of brown adipocyte-related genes UCP1, UCP3, PGC1α and PRDM16, as well as COX8B and ATP5B. Both leucine and TSC1 deletion blocked nesfatin-1-induced up-regulation of UCP1, PGC1α, COX8B and ATP5B in differentiated brown adipocytes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMutation in a tuberous sclerosis gene (TSC1 or 2) leads to continuous activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR activation alters cellular including vitamin A metabolism and retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ) expression. The goal of the present study was to investigate the molecular connection between vitamin A metabolism and TSC mutation. We also aimed to investigate the effect of the FDA approved drug rapamycin and the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) in cell lines with TSC mutation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nExpression and activity of vitamin A associated metabolic enzymes and RARβ were assessed in human kidney angiomyolipoma derived cell lines, primary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) tissue derived LAM cell lines. RARβ protein levels were also tested in primary LAM lung tissue sections. TaqMan arrays, enzyme activities, qRT-PCRs, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescent staining, and western blotting were performed and analysed. The functional effects of retinoic acid (RA) and rapamycin were tested in a scratch and a BrDU assay to assess cell migration and proliferation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMetabolic enzyme arrays revealed a general deregulation of many enzymes involved in vitamin A metabolism including aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). Furthermore, RARβ downregulation was a characteristic feature of all TSC-deficient cell lines and primary tissues. Combination of the two FDA approved drugs -RA for acute myeloid leukaemia and rapamycin for TSC mutation- normalised ALDH and ADH expression and activity, restored RARβ expression and reduced cellular proliferation and migration.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDeregulation of vitamin A metabolizing enzymes is a feature of TSC mutation. RA can normalize RARβ levels and limit cell migration but does not have a significant effect on proliferation. Based on our data, translational studies could confirm whether combination of RA with reduced dosage of rapamycin would have more beneficial effects to higher dosage of rapamycin monotherapy meanwhile reducing adverse effects of rapamycin for patients with TSC mutation.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis, also called Bourneville Pringle disease, is a phakomatosis with potential dermal, nerve, kidney and lung damage. It is characterized by the development of benign proliferations in many organs, which result in different clinical manifestations. It is associated with the mutation of two genes: TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), with the change in the functionality of the complex target of rapamycin (mTOR). MTOR activation signal has been recently described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its inhibition could be beneficial in patients with lupus nephritis. We report the case of a patient who began with clinical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 30 years after the onset of SLE with severe renal disease (tipe IV nephritis) who improved after treatment with iv pulses of cyclophosphamide. We found only two similar cases in the literature, and hence considered the coexistence of these two entities of great interest.",

    "issue": "51(1)",

    "abstract": "Progressive lung tissue destruction in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) occurs as a result of excessive proliferation of LAM cells caused by a mutation in one of the tuberous sclerosis complex suppressor genes, TSC1 or TSC2. These cells show constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and many of the mTOR-related kinases such as Akt, Erk, S6K1 and S6. Phenotype of LAM cells differs considerably depending on their microenvironment. LAM cells show differences in morphology, size and expression of various factors depending on their location in the tumor or body fluids. The presence of LAM cells in blood, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and chyle proves their ability to metastasis. Antigens of smooth muscle cells are expressed in most LAM cells. Some of these cells are immunoreactive with HMB-45 antibody, which is used for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of LAM. Receptors for estrogen and progesterone may also be expressed in these cells, which probably is associated with the fact that LAM occurs almost exclusively in women of childbearing age. LAM cells via increased production of metalloproteinases are involved in the destruction of the extracellular matrix, as well as the remodeling and damage of lung tissue. Sporadic LAM occurs extremely rarely. Therefore a good experimental model of this disease is necessary. To date, several animal and human cell lines, which both genetically and phenotypically resemble LAM cells, have been obtained. These cell lines, derived from LAM nodule or an angiomyolipoma, are usually characterized by a mutation of the TSC2 gene, expression of smooth muscle cell antigens such as a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) or S6K1 and S6 protein hyperphosphorylation. Presently, there is no commercially available cell line representing a good model of LAM. A better understanding of LAM cell biology is necessary for creating a useful model in vitro for further exploration of both LAM pathomechanisms and more general mechanisms of carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare cystic lung disease with multi-organ involvement, occurs primarily in women of childbearing age. LAM can present sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Loss of lung function in patients with LAM can be attributed to the dysregulated growth of LAM cells, with dysfunctional TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively, leading to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). LAM cells are smooth muscle-like cells that express melanoma antigens such as gp100, a splice variant of the Pmel17 gene. Tuberin and hamartin form heterodimers that act as negative regulators of mTOR. Lack of TSC2 function, as occurs in LAM cells, leads to the production of the chemokine CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), which increases LAM cell mobility. Although many chemokines and their receptors could influence LAM cell mobilization, we propose that a positive-feedback loop is generated when dysfunctional TSC2 is present in LAM cells. We identified a group of chemokine receptors that is expressed in LAM cells and differs from those on smooth muscle and melanoma cells (Malme-3M). Chemokines have been implicated in tumor metastasis, and our data suggest a role for chemokines in LAM cell mobilization and thereby in the pathogenesis of LAM.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a major sensor of nutrient and energy availability in the cell and regulates a variety of cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes (TSC1 or TSC2) leads to constitutive activation of mTOR and downstream signaling elements, resulting in the development of tumors, neurological disorders, and at the cellular level, severe insulin/IGF-1 resistance. Here, we show that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 in cell lines and mouse or human tumors causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). The resulting ER stress plays a significant role in the mTOR-mediated negative-feedback inhibition of insulin action and increases the vulnerability to apoptosis. These results demonstrate ER stress as a critical component of the pathologies associated with dysregulated mTOR activity and offer the possibility to exploit this mechanism for new therapeutic opportunities.",

    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "Studies attempting to identify and understand the function of mutated genes and deregulated molecular pathways in cancer have been ongoing for many years. The PI3K-PTEN-mTOR signaling pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in cancer. PIK3CA mutations are found 11%-33% of head and neck cancer (HNC). The hotspot mutation sites for PIK3CA are E542K, E545K and H1047R/L. The PTEN somatic mutations are in 9-23% of HNC, and they frequently cluster in the phosphatase domain of PTEN protein. PTEN loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ranges from 41%-71% and loss of PTEN protein expression occurs in 31.2% of the HNC samples. PIK3CA and PTEN are key molecules in the PI3K-PTEN-mTOR signaling pathway. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of mutations in the PI3K-PTEN-mTOR molecular circuitry in HNC, including PI3K family members, TSC1/TSC2, PTEN, AKT, and mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. We discussed how these genetic alterations may affect protein structure and function. We also highlight the latest discoveries in protein kinase and tumor suppressor families, emphasizing how mutations in these families interfere with PI3K signaling. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy will inform selection of novel genomic-based personalized therapies for head and neck cancer patients.",

    "issue": "36()",
    "pages": "304-315",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPancreatic fibrosis is a pathophysiological process associated with excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in pancreas, leading to reduced insulin secretion and derangement of glucose metabolism. X/A-like cells, a group of unique endocrine cells in gastric oxyntic mucosa, produce and secret ghrelin to influence energy balance. Whether gastric X/A-like cells affect pancreatic fibrosis and subsequent glucose homeostasis remains unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe established a Ghrl-cre transgene in which the cre enzyme is expressed in X/A-like cells under the control of ghrelin-promoter. TSC1flox/flox mice were bred with Ghrl-cre mice to generate Ghrl-TSC1-/- (TG) mice, within which mTORC1 signaling was activated in X/A-like cells. Pancreatic fibrosis and insulin secretion were analyzed in the TG mice.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nActivation of mTORC1 signaling by deletion of TSC1 gene in gastric X/A-like cells induced spontaneous pancreatic fibrosis. This alteration was associated with reduced insulin expression and secretion, as well as impaired glucose metabolism. Activation of mTORC1 signaling in gastric X/A-like cells reduced gastric and circulating ghrelin levels. Exogenous ghrelin reversed pancreatic fibrosis and glucose intolerance induced by activation of mTORC1 signaling in these cells. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, reversed the decrease of ghrelin levels and pancreatic fibrosis.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nActivation of mTORC1 signaling in gastric X/A-like cells induces spontaneous pancreatic fibrosis and subsequently impairs glucose homeostasis via suppression of ghrelin.",

    "pages": "229",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is regulated by 17α-estradiol (E2) signaling and mediates E2-induced proliferation and progesterone receptor (PgR) expression in breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nHere we use deep sequencing analysis of previously published data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to demonstrate that expression of a key component of mTOR signaling, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), positively correlated with an estrogen receptor-α positive (ERα+) breast tumor signature. Through increased microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression in the ERα+ breast cancer cells we demonstrate repression of Rictor enhanced activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling with both qPCR and western blot. miR-155-mediated mTOR signaling resulted in deregulated ERα signaling both in cultured cells in vitro and in xenografts in vivo in addition to repressed PgR expression and activity. Furthermore we observed that miR-155 enhanced mTORC1 signaling (observed through western blot for increased phosphorylation on mTOR S2448) and induced inhibition of mTORC2 signaling (evident through repressed Rictor and tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) gene expression). mTORC1 induced deregulation of E2 signaling was confirmed using qPCR and the mTORC1-specific inhibitor RAD001. Co-treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells stably overexpressing miR-155 with RAD001 and E2 restored E2-induced PgR gene expression. RAD001 treatment of SCID/CB17 mice inhibited E2-induced tumorigenesis of the MCF7 miR-155 overexpressing cell line. Finally we demonstrated a strong positive correlation between Rictor and PgR expression and a negative correlation with Raptor expression in Luminal B breast cancer samples, a breast cancer histological subtype known for having an altered ERα-signaling pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nmiRNA mediated alterations in mTOR and ERα signaling establishes a new mechanism for altered estrogen responses independent of growth factor stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, knowledge of the full effects of metformin on biochemical pathways and processes in its primary target tissue, the liver, is limited. One established effect of metformin is to decrease cellular energy levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) are key regulators of metabolism that are respectively activated and inhibited in acute response to cellular energy depletion. Here we show that metformin robustly inhibits mTORC1 in mouse liver tissue and primary hepatocytes. Using mouse genetics, we find that at the lowest concentrations of metformin that inhibit hepatic mTORC1 signaling, this inhibition is dependent on AMPK and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex (TSC complex). Finally, we show that metformin profoundly inhibits hepatocyte protein synthesis in a manner that is largely dependent on its ability to suppress mTORC1 signaling.",

    "issue": "9(4)",
    "pages": "e95393",
    "abstract": "Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid widely found in medicinal herbs and fruits, has been reported to possess a wide range of beneficial properties including anti-hyperglycemia, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of UA remain largely unknown. Here we show that UA inhibits leucine-induced activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in C2C12 myotubes. The UA-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 is independent of Akt, tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), suggesting that UA negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting at a site downstream of these mTOR regulators. UA treatment had no effect on the interaction between mTOR and its activator Raptor or inhibitor Deptor, but suppressed the binding of RagB to Raptor and inhibited leucine-induced mTOR lysosomal localization. Taken together, our study identifies UA as a direct negative regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and suggests a novel mechanism by which UA exerts its beneficial function.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. To date, there has been little work to elucidate regional TSC1 and TSC2 gene expression within the human brain, how it changes with age, and how it may influence disease. Using a publicly available microarray dataset, we found that TSC1 and TSC2 gene expression was highest within the adult neo-cerebellum and that this pattern of increased cerebellar expression was maintained throughout postnatal development. During mid-gestational fetal development, however, TSC1 and TSC2 expression was highest in the cortical plate. Using a bioinformatics approach to explore protein and genetic interactions, we confirmed extensive connections between TSC1/TSC2 and the other genes that comprise the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and show that the mTOR pathway genes with the highest connectivity are also selectively expressed within the cerebellum. Finally, compared to age-matched controls, we found increased cerebellar volumes in pediatric TSC patients without current exposure to antiepileptic drugs. Considered together, these findings suggest that the cerebellum may play a central role in TSC pathogenesis and may contribute to the cognitive impairment, including the high incidence of autism spectrum disorder, observed in the TSC population.",

    "issue": "1852(2)",
    "pages": "332-42",
    "abstract": "Prolonged caloric restriction often results in alteration in heart geometry and function although the underlying mechanism remains poorly defined. Autophagy, a conserved pathway for bulk degradation of intracellular proteins and organelles, preserves energy and nutrient in the face of caloric insufficiency. This study was designed to examine the role of AMPK in prolonged caloric restriction-induced change in cardiac homeostasis and the underlying mechanism(s) involved with a focus on autophagy. Wild-type (WT) and AMPK kinase dead (KD) mice were caloric restricted (by 40%) for 30 weeks. Echocardiographic, cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca²⁺ properties, autophagy and autophagy regulatory proteins were evaluated. Caloric restriction compromised echocardiographic indices (decreased ventricular mass, left ventricular diameters, and cardiac output), cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca²⁺ properties associated with upregulated autophagy (Beclin-1, Atg5 and LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio), increased autophagy adaptor protein p62, elevated phosphorylation of AMPK and TSC1/2, depressed phosphorylation of mTOR and ULK1. Although AMPK inhibition did not affect cardiac mechanical function, autophagy and autophagy signaling proteins, it significantly accentuated caloric restriction-induced changes in myocardial contractile function and intracellular Ca²⁺ handling. Interestingly, AMPK inhibition reversed caloric restriction-induced changes in autophagy and autophagy signaling. AMPK inhibition led to dampened levels of Beclin-1, Atg 5 and LC3B ratio along with suppressed phosphorylation of AMPK and TSC1/2 as well as elevated phosphorylation of mTOR and ULK1. Taken together, these data suggest an indispensible role for AMPK in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis under prolonged caloric restriction-induced pathological changes possibly through autophagy regulation.

    "issue": "144(8)",
    "pages": "1445-1462",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nIt has been reported that PI3K/AKT pathway is altered in various cancers and AKT isoforms specifically regulate cell growth and metastasis of cancer cells; AKT1, but not AKT2, reduces invasion of cancer cells but maintains cancer growth. We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2, that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells via AKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTransduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression in various cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays can evaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473 residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in various human breast cancer tissues.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducing Raptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead to significant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breast cancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase, indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, the TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis and downregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2 pathway.",

    "pages": "1297-1305",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRhabdomyoma is the most common cardiac tumour in children. It is usually associated with tuberous sclerosis complex caused by mutations in TSC-1 or TSC-2 genes. This tumour typically regresses by unknown mechanisms; however, it may cause inflow or outflow obstruction that necessitates urgent surgery. Here we investigate the clinical features and the genetic analysis of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex presenting with large rhabdomyoma tumours. We also investigate the potential role of autophagy and apoptosis in the pathogenesis of this tumour.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll the patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma referred to Aswan Heart Centre from 2010 to 2018 were included in this study. Sanger sequencing was performed for coding exons and the flanking intronic regions of TSC1 and TSC2 genes. Histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were performed with P62, LC3b, caspase3, and caspase7, to evaluate autophagic and apoptotic signaling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive patients were included and had the clinical features of tuberous sclerosis complex. Three patients, who were having obstructive tumours, were found to have pathogenic mutations in TSC-2. The expression of two autophagic markers, P62 and LC3b, and two apoptotic markers, caspase3 and caspase7, were increased in the tumour cells compared to normal surrounding myocardial tissue.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll the patients with rhabdomyoma were diagnosed to have tuberous sclerosis complex. The patients who had pathogenic mutations in the TSC-2 gene had a severe disease form necessitating urgent intervention. We also demonstrate the potential role of autophagy and apoptosis as a possible mechanism for tumourigenesis and regression. Future studies will help in designing personalised treatment for cardiac rhabdomyoma.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a key endocrine organ that governs systemic homeostasis. PPARγ is a master regulator of adipose tissue signaling that plays an essential role in insulin sensitivity, making it an important therapeutic target. The selective PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (RSG) has been used to treat diabetes. However, adverse cardiovascular effects have seriously hindered its clinical application. Experimental models have revealed that PPARγ activation increases cardiac hypertrophy. RSG stimulates cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress in cardiomyocyte-specific PPARγ knockout mice, implying that RSG might stimulate cardiac hypertrophy independently of cardiomyocyte PPARγ. However, candidate cell types responsible for RSG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy remain unexplored. Utilizing cocultures of adipocytes and cardiomyocytes, we found that stimulation of PPARγ signaling in adipocytes increased miR-200a expression and secretion. Delivery of miR-200a in adipocyte-derived exosomes to cardiomyocytes resulted in decreased TSC1 and subsequent mTOR activation, leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Treatment with an antagomir to miR-200a blunted this hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes. In vivo, specific ablation of PPARγ in adipocytes was sufficient to blunt hypertrophy induced by RSG treatment. By delineating mechanisms by which RSG elicits cardiac hypertrophy, we have identified pathways that mediate the crosstalk between adipocytes and cardiomyocytes to regulate cardiac remodeling.",

Recent work has indicated that the TSC1-TSC2 complex plays a role in the pathobiology of a number of tumor predisposition syndromes, including tuberous sclerosis (TSC1/2), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (LKB1), and Cowden's syndrome (PTEN), in which the TSC/Rheb/mTOR axis is inappropriately active secondary to loss of tumor suppressor function. Recent work has demonstrated that TSC deficiency imposes a negative autoregulatory loop that suppresses insulin signaling at the post-receptor level, effectively resulting in cell autonomous insulin resistance. Exploitation of this insulin signaling deficiency may hold promise among tailored clinical therapies designed to manage tuberous sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Oxidants are well recognized for their capacity to reduce the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) substrates, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), thereby hindering mRNA translation at the level of initiation. mTOR functions to regulate mRNA translation by forming the signaling complex mTORC1 (mTOR, raptor, GbetaL). Insulin signaling to mTORC1 is dependent upon phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and the inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2), thereby enhancing the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1. In this study we report the effect of H(2)O(2) on insulin-stimulated mTORC1 activity and assembly using A549 and bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. We show that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of TSC2 leading to a reduction in raptor-mTOR binding and in the quantity of proline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) precipitating with mTOR. Insulin also increased 4E-BP1 coprecipitating with mTOR and the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K1. H(2)O(2), on the other hand, opposed the effects of insulin by increasing raptor-mTOR binding and the ratio of PRAS40/raptor derived from the mTOR immunoprecipitates in both cell types. These effects occurred in conjunction with a reduction in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and the 4E-BP1/raptor ratio. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRAS40 in A549 cells partially reversed the effect of H(2)O(2) on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but not on S6K1. These findings are consistent with PRAS40 functioning as a negative regulator of insulin-stimulated mTORC1 activity during oxidant stress.",

    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal gastrointestinal malignancies worldwide. Many studies have shown that development of GC and other malignancies is mainly driven by alterations of cellular signaling pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding molecules that function as tumor-suppressors or oncogenes, playing an essential role in a variety of fundamental biological processes. In order to understand the functional relevance of miRNA dysregulation, studies analyzing their target genes are of major importance. Here, we chose to analyze two miRNAs, miR-20b and miR-451a, shown to be deregulated in many different malignancies, including GC. Deregulated expression of miR-20b and miR-451a was determined in GC cell lines and the INS-GAS mouse model. Using Western Blot and luciferase reporter assay we determined that miR-20b directly regulates expression of PTEN and TXNIP, and miR-451a: CAV1 and TSC1. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that down-regulation of miR-20b and up-regulation of miR-451a expression exhibits an anti-tumor effect in vitro (miR-20b: reduced viability, colony formation, increased apoptosis rate, and miR-451a: reduced colony forming ability). To summarize, the present study identified that expression of miR-20b and miR-451a are deregulated in vitro and in vivo and have a tumor suppressive role in GC through regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "issue": "39(47)",
    "pages": "9294-9305",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 Patients frequently have epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and/or intellectual disability, as well as other systemic manifestations. In this study, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a female patient with TSC with one or two mutations in TSC2 into neurons using induced expression of NGN2 to examine neuronal dysregulation associated with the neurological symptoms in TSC. Using this method, neuronal differentiation was comparable between the three genotypes of iPSCs. We observed that TSC2+/- neurons show mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivation and associated increased cell body size and process outgrowth, as well as exacerbation of the abnormalities by loss of the second allele of TSC2 in TSC2-/- neurons. Interestingly, iPSC-derived neurons with either a single or biallelic mutation in TSC2 demonstrated hypersynchrony and downregulation of FMRP targets. However, only neurons with biallelic mutations of TSC2 demonstrated hyperactivity and transcriptional dysregulation observed in cortical tubers. These data demonstrate that loss of one allele of TSC2 is sufficient to cause some morphological and physiological changes in human neurons but that biallelic mutations in TSC2 are necessary to induce gene expression dysregulation present in cortical tubers. Finally, we found that treatment of iPSC-derived neurons with rapamycin reduced neuronal activity and partially reversed gene expression abnormalities, demonstrating that mTOR dysregulation contributes to both phenotypes. Therefore, biallelic mutations in TSC2 and associated molecular dysfunction, including mTOR hyperactivation, may play a role in the development of cortical tubers.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study, we examined neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells with two, one, or no functional TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2) alleles and found that loss of one or both alleles of TSC2 results in mTORC1 hyperactivation and specific neuronal abnormalities. However, only biallelic mutations in TSC2 resulted in elevated neuronal activity and upregulation of cell adhesion genes that is also observed in cortical tubers. These data suggest that loss of heterozygosity of TSC1 or TSC2 may play an important role in the development of cortical tubers, and potentially epilepsy, in patients with TSC.",

    "issue": "172(4)",
    "pages": "402-421",
    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays an essential role in regulation of normal cell growth, metabolism, and survival. Somatic activating mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are among the most common mutations identified in cancer, and have been shown to cause a spectrum of overgrowth syndromes including PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum, Proteus syndrome, and brain overgrowth conditions. Clinical findings in these disorders may be isolated or multiple, including sporadic or mosaic overgrowth (adipose, skeletal, muscle, brain, vascular, or lymphatic), and skin abnormalities (including epidermal nevi, hyper-, and hypopigmented lesions), and have the potential risk of tumorigenesis. Key negative regulators of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway include PTEN and TSC1/TSC2 and germline loss-of function mutations of these genes are established to cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Mosaic forms of these conditions lead to increased activation of PI3K and mTOR at affected sites and there is phenotypic overlap between these conditions. All are associated with significant morbidity with limited options for treatment other than symptomatic therapies and surgeries. As dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been implicated in cancer, several small molecule inhibitors targeting different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are under clinical investigation. The development of these therapies brings closer the prospect of targeting treatment for somatic PI3K/AKT/mTOR-related overgrowth syndromes. This review describes the clinical findings, gene function and pathogenesis of these mosaic overgrowth syndromes, and presents existing and future treatment strategies to reduce or prevent associated complications of these disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a pediatric disorder of dysregulated growth and differentiation caused by loss of function mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which regulate mTOR kinase activity. To study aberrations of early development in TSC, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells using dermal fibroblasts obtained from patients with TSC. During validation, we found that stem cells generated from TSC patients had a very high rate of integration of the reprogramming plasmid containing a shRNA against TP53. We also found that loss of one allele of TSC2 in human fibroblasts is sufficient to increase p53 levels and impair stem cell reprogramming. Increased p53 was also observed in TSC2 heterozygous and homozygous mutant human stem cells, suggesting that the interactions between TSC2 and p53 are consistent across cell types and gene dosage. These results support important contributions of TSC2 heterozygous and homozygous mutant cells to the pathogenesis of TSC and the important role of p53 during reprogramming.",

    "pages": "6243-55",
    "abstract": "The TSC2 gene, mutated in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), encodes a 200 kDa protein TSC2 (tuberin). The importance of TSC2 in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation is irrefutable. TSC2 in complex with TSC1 negatively regulates the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) via RHEB in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and in turn regulates cell proliferation. It shows nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localization. However, its nuclear function remains elusive. In order to identify the nuclear function of TSC2, a whole-genome expression profiling of TSC2 overexpressing cells was performed, and the results showed differential regulation of 266 genes. Interestingly, transcription was found to be the most populated functional category. EREG (Epiregulin), a member of the epidermal growth factor family, was found to be the most downregulated gene in the microarray analysis. Previous reports have documented elevated levels of EREG in TSC lesions, making its regulatory aspects intriguing. Using the luciferase reporter, ChIP and EMSA techniques, we show that TSC2 binds to the EREG promoter between -352 bp and -303 bp and negatively regulates its expression. This is the first evidence for the role of TSC2 as a transcription factor and of TSC2 binding to the promoter of any gene.",

    "issue": "34(9)",
    "pages": "12502-12520",
    "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a particularly vulnerable tissue to age-dependent degeneration. Over the life span, the RPE develops an expanded endo-lysosomal compartment to maintain the high efficiency of phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) necessary for photoreceptor survival. As the assembly and activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) occur on the lysosome surface, increased lysosome mass with aging leads to higher mTORC1 activity. The functional consequences of hyperactive mTORC1 in the RPE are unclear. In the current study, we used integrated high-resolution metabolomic and genomic approaches to examine mice with RPE-specific deletion of the tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) gene which encodes an upstream suppressor of mTORC1. Our data show that RPE cells with constitutively high mTORC1 activity were reprogramed to be hyperactive in glucose and lipid metabolism. Lipolysis was suppressed, mitochondrial carnitine shuttle was inhibited, while genes involved in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis were upregulated. The metabolic changes occurred prior to structural changes of RPE and retinal degeneration. These findings have revealed cellular events and intrinsic mechanisms that contribute to lipid accumulation in the RPE cells during aging and age-related degeneration.",

    "title": "Autophagy and ethanol neurotoxicity.",
    "issue": "10(12)",
    "pages": "2099-108",
    "abstract": "Excessive ethanol exposure is detrimental to the brain. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not declined, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells, and is involved in cell differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity. We have recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated; their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling, alterations in BCL2 family proteins, and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. This review discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in ethanol-mediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of targeting autophagic pathways.",

    "issue": "2017()",
    "pages": "9820181",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of benign, noninvasive, and tumor-like lesions called hamartomas that can affect multiple organ systems and are responsible for the clinical features of the disease. In the majority of cases, TSC results from mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, leading to the overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, which controls several cell functions, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The establishment of a connection between TSC and mTOR led to the clinical use of drugs known as mTOR inhibitors (like rapamycin, also known as sirolimus and everolimus), which are becoming an increasingly interesting tool in the management of TSC-associated features, such as subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, renal angiomyolipomas, and also epilepsy. However, the intrinsic characteristics of these drugs and their systemic effects in such a heterogeneous condition pose many challenges in clinical practice, so that some questions remain unanswered. This article provides an overview of the pharmacological aspects of mTOR inhibitors about the clinical trials leading to their approval in TSC-related conditions and exposes current challenges and future directions associated with this promising therapeutic line.",

    "issue": "33(12)",
    "pages": "2580-2590",
    "abstract": "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) is a histologically and molecularly distinct class of rare renal tumor. TCGA studies revealed low mutational burden, with only TP53 and PTEN recurrently mutated, and discovered alterations in TERT promoter and in the electron transport chain Complex I genes. However, knowledge on drug targetable genes is limited and treatments at metastatic stage do not follow a molecular rationale. In a large series of 92 chRCC enriched with metastatic cases, we performed an in-depth characterization of mTOR pathway alterations through targeted NGS and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of phospho-S6, tuberin, and PTEN. Mutations in mitochondria, telomere maintenance and other renal cancer related genes and p53 IHC, were also assessed. The impact on metastasis development and disease specific survival was determined, using TCGA-KICH series (n = 65) for validation. mTOR pathway mutations (MTOR, TSC1, TSC2) were present in 17% of primary tumors, most of them being classified as pathogenic. Mutations were associated with positive IHC staining of phospho-S6 and PTEN (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively) and with chRCC eosinophilic variant (P = 0.039), supporting a biological relevance of the pathway. mTOR pathway mutations were associated with worse clinical outcomes. Survival analysis gave a hazard ratio of 5.5 (P = 0.027), and this association was confirmed in TCGA-KICH (HR = 10.3, P = 0.006). TP53 mutations were enriched in metastatic cases (P = 0.018), and mutations in telomere maintenance genes showed a trend in the same direction. p53 IHC staining pattern was associated with the underlying TP53 defect, and negative PTEN IHC staining (82% of cases) suggested PTEN loss as a chRCC hallmark. In conclusion, our study provides with novel genomic knowledge in chRCC and identifies novel markers of poor survival. Furthermore, this is the first study showing that mTOR pathway mutations correlate with poor prognosis, and may help to identify patients with increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, a hamartoma disorder characterized by benign tumors of the hair follicle, lung cysts, and renal neoplasia, is caused by germ-line mutations in the BHD(FLCN) gene, which encodes a tumor-suppressor protein, folliculin (FLCN), with unknown function. The tumor-suppressor proteins encoded by genes responsible for several other hamartoma syndromes, LKB1, TSC1/2, and PTEN, have been shown to be involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Here, we report the identification of the FLCN-interacting protein, FNIP1, and demonstrate its interaction with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key molecule for energy sensing that negatively regulates mTOR activity. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and its phosphorylation was reduced by AMPK inhibitors, which resulted in reduced FNIP1 expression. AMPK inhibitors also reduced FLCN phosphorylation. Moreover, FLCN phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN may be regulated by mTOR and AMPK signaling. Our data suggest that FLCN, mutated in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, and its interacting partner FNIP1 may be involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "AIM\nAs a result of mutations in TSC1 (9q34) and TSC2 (16p13.3) tumor supressor genes, the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTor) signaling pathway is overactivated in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation is responsible for the growth several different tumors. The aim of this study was to review tumors in our patients with tuberous sclerosis.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThirty-six patients with tuberous sclerosis were reviewed retrospectively in terms of age, sex, family history, clinical findings, presence of tumors, and treatments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur study included 36 patients (18/18:M/F) aged between two days and 17 years with a median age of 6 years. There were hypopigmented spots in 30 patients, seizures in 28 patients, and a family history in 11 patients. Tumors related to tuberous sclerosis were renal angiomyolipomas in 21 patients, cardiac rhabdomyomas in 11, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas in seven, and non renal hamartoma in one patient. Everolimus treatment was used in only two patients because of hemodynamic instability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTuberous sclerosis is a multisystemic disease characterized by the presence of various benign tumors and neurologic disorders. Renal angiomyolipomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are commonly observed in patients with tuberous sclerosis. mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and sirolimus have been increasingly used in the treatment of these tumors. However, the duration and optimal dose of mTOR inhibitors is still controversial and should be used in selected cases.",

    "issue": "31(3)",
    "pages": "292-8",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis (TS) is a systemic disease, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance caused by mutations in two genes (TSC1 and TSC2) that cause tumours (angiomyolipomas [AML], angiofibromas, astrocytomas). Constant and inadequate proliferation occurring in TS may be blocked by mTOR inhibitors (mammalian target of rapamycin), such as rapamycin.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nAt present, our study includes 17 patients with TS. All had at least one AML greater than 2cm in diameter diagnosed by MRI. They received rapamycin during 12 months. Plasma levels remained stable between 4-8ng/dl. The AML size was monitored every six months by abdominal MRI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 12 months of inclusion, MRI indicated a decrease in the size of AML in all patients showing at least a 50% reduction in 82.4% (14/17, 95% CI [56.57%, 96.20%]). The mean percent reduction was 66.3% (95% CI [56.9%, 75.6%], P<.0001). The major side effects observed were: oral aphthous ulcers (5/17); hypertriglyceridemia (3/17); microcytosis and hypochromia (3/17); diarrhea (2/17); acne (1/17); acute pyelonephritis (1/17); and proteinuria (1/17).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese preliminary clinical data suggest that rapamycin can play a beneficial role in the treatment of TS. Our experience in 17 patients treated for 12 months demonstrates safety and efficacy in reducing AML volume.",

    "issue": "111(36)",
    "pages": "13163-8",
    "abstract": "Although ghrelin has been demonstrated to stimulate energy intake and storage through a central mechanism, its effect on hepatic lipid metabolism remains largely uncharacterized. Ghrelin receptor antagonism or gene deletion significantly decreased obesity-associated hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis, whereas exogenous ghrelin stimulated lipogenesis, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation in mice. The effects of ghrelin were mediated by direct activation of its receptor on hepatocytes. Cultured hepatocytes responded to ghrelin with increased lipid content and expression of lipogenesis-related genes. Ghrelin increased phosphorylation of S6, the downstream target of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in cultured hepatocytes, whereas ghrelin receptor antagonism reduced hepatic phosphorylation of S6 in db/db mice. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin markedly attenuated ghrelin-induced up-regulation of lipogenesis in hepatocytes, whereas activation of hepatic mTOR signaling by deletion of TSC1 increased hepatic lipogenesis. By interacting with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), mTOR mediates the ghrelin-induced up-regulation of lipogenesis in hepatocytes. The stimulatory effect of ghrelin on hepatic lipogenesis was significantly attenuated by PPARγ antagonism in cultured hepatocytes and in PPARγ gene-deficient mice. Our study indicates that ghrelin activates its receptor on hepatocytes to promote lipogenesis via a mechanism involving the mTOR-PPARγ signaling pathway.",

Upon activation, T cells undergo significant morphological and functional changes, putting new metabolic demands on the cell. Past research has identified the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a critical regulator of cell metabolism, and the development of new genetic models has begun to reveal an important role for this pathway in the homeostasis and function of T lymphocytes. In this review, we focus on the most recent findings that demonstrate the ability of mTOR to regulate T-cell activation, CD8(+) memory cell formation and function, and helper T lineage differentiation. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of tight control of mTOR signaling by tuberous sclerosis complex 1 for T-cell homeostasis, and the regulation of mTOR signaling by diacylglycerol kinases and the RasGRP1-Ras-Erk1/2 pathway in the context of TCR signaling.",

    "pages": "13489-94",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either of the two tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Tuberin and hamartin form a complex that inhibits signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical nutrient sensor and regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inactivates the tumor suppressor complex and enhances mTOR signaling by means of phosphorylation of tuberin by Akt. Importantly, cellular transformation mediated by phorbol esters and Ras isoforms that poorly activate PI3K promote tumorigenesis in the absence of Akt activation. In this study, we show that phorbol esters and activated Ras also induce the phosphorylation of tuberin and collaborates with the nutrient-sensing pathway to regulate mTOR effectors, such as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated kinase, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 1, was found to interact with and phosphorylate tuberin at a regulatory site, Ser-1798, located at the evolutionarily conserved C terminus of tuberin. RSK1 phosphorylation of Ser-1798 inhibits the tumor suppressor function of the tuberin/hamartin complex, resulting in increased mTOR signaling to S6K1. Together, our data unveil a regulatory mechanism by which the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways converge on the tumor suppressor tuberin to inhibit its function.",

    "pages": "1347-1354",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nThe phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which regulates multiple cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, motility, growth, and survival, is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in human cancers. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade can be aberrantly activated by multiple factors, including diverse oncogenic genomic alterations in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, AKT, TSC1, TSC2, LKB1, MTOR, and other critical genes, which can be used as targets for anticancer therapy. Limited single-agent activity, high levels of toxic effects, and a lack of predictive biomarkers for treatment selection have all been major barriers to the clinical development of these compounds. Many adverse effects are uncommon and have poorly understood mechanisms. An understanding of these toxic effects, as well as a better definition of management guidelines, will be important because more PI3K inhibitors are under development and may soon be incorporated into routine practice.\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nA search of PubMed, draft prescribing information of currently approved PI3K inhibitors, European Medical Association and US Food and Drug Administration product information, and expert panel opinion on the management of the prominent toxic effects of this class of agents was conducted on August 29, 2018. This article provides an overview of the main toxic effects of PI3K inhibitors reported in clinical trials and a summary of recommendations for identification and management of treatment-emergent toxic effects, including hypoglycemia, cutaneous reactions, pneumonitis, neuropsychiatric effects, hepatotoxic effects, diarrhea, and colitis. Overall, the clinical development of most PI3K inhibitors has been discontinued owing to insufficient activity, problematic toxic effects, and the absence of biomarkers correlated with clinical activity. Knowledge of the isoforms and their distribution in tissue can help clinicians anticipate toxic effects. Notably, novel, more specific inhibitors for individual isoforms of PI3K showed therapeutic activity with improved toxic effect profiles compared with non-isoform-selective agents.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAn improved understanding of the complexities of the main toxic-effect mechanisms and their management might open viable paths to advancing PI3K inhibitors from clinical studies to new standard-of-care treatments.",

    "title": "Akt regulates nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of tuberin.",
    "issue": "26(4)",
    "pages": "521-31",
    "abstract": "The autosomal dominantly inherited disease tuberous sclerosis (TSC) affects approximately 1 in 6000 individuals and is characterized by the development of tumors, named hamartomas, in different organs. TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin are tumor suppressor genes responsible for TSC. Hamartin and tuberin form a complex, of which tuberin is assumed to be the functional component. The TSC proteins have been implicated in the control of cell cycle by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and in cell size regulation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K cascade. Phosphorylation of S939 and T1462 by Akt downregulates tuberin's potential to inhibit mTOR/p70S6K. Here, we show that this tuberin phosphorylation by Akt does not affect tuberin-mediated control of p27 protein amounts. This demonstrates that regulating p27 protein amounts and mTOR/p70S6K are separable functions of tuberin. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation by Akt triggers upregulation of cytoplasmic and downregulation of nuclear tuberin. In cycling cells with high Akt activity, tuberin is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. In arrested G0 cells with downregulated Akt activity, a significant proportion of tuberin is localized to the nucleus. Upon re-entry into the normal ongoing cell cycle, nuclear localization of tuberin is downregulated parallel to the activation of Akt. Recently, the mTOR/p70S6K cascade has been demonstrated to exist in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. We here also found that tuberin harbors the potential to regulate p70S6K activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. This description of functional tuberin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus together with our observation of Akt-controlled and cell cycle-regulated tuberin localization are of particular interest for a further understanding of tuberin's function as a gate keeper of the G0 cell status as well as of Akt's activity to control cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Tissue stem cells temporally change intrinsic mechanisms to meet physiological demands. However, little is known whether and how stem cells rely on distinct extrinsic maintenance mechanisms over time. Here, we found that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) temporally transition to depend on thrombopoietin (TPO), a key extrinsic factor, from E16.5 onward in the developing liver. Deletion of Tpo reduced mTOR activity, induced differentiation gene expression, and preferentially depleted metabolically active HSCs. Ectopic activation of the JAK2 or MAPK pathway did not rescue HSCs in Tpo mice. Enforced activation of the mTOR pathway by conditionally deleting Tsc1 significantly rescued HSCs and their gene expression in Tpo mice. Lin28b intrinsically promoted mTOR activation in HSCs, and its expression diminished over time. Conditional deletion of Lin28b further reduced mTOR activity and strongly exacerbated HSC depletion in Tpo mice. Therefore, HSCs temporally transition from intrinsic LIN28B-dependent to extrinsic TPO-dependent maintenance in the developing liver.",

    "abstract": "Development of effective immune therapies for cancer patients requires better understanding of hurdles that prevent the generation of effective antitumor immune responses. Administration of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) in animals enhances antitumor immunity via activation of the invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. However, repeated injections of α-GalCer result in long-term unresponsiveness or anergy of iNKT cells, severely limiting its efficacy in tumor eradication. The mechanisms leading to iNKT cell anergy remain poorly understood. We report in this study that the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), a negative regulator of mTOR signaling, plays a crucial role in iNKT cell anergy. Deficiency of TSC1 in iNKT cells results in resistance to α-GalCer-induced anergy, manifested by increased expansion of and cytokine production by iNKT cells in response to secondary Ag stimulation. It is correlated with impaired upregulation of programmed death-1, Egr2, and Grail. Moreover, TSC1-deficient iNKT cells display enhanced antitumor immunity in a melanoma lung metastasis model. Our data suggest targeting TSC1/2 as a strategy for boosting antitumor immune therapy.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation has been thought to limit the progression of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) because loss of medial cells associates with advanced disease. We investigated effects of SMC proliferation in the aortic media by conditional disruption of Tsc1, which hyperactivates mTOR complex 1. Consequent SMC hyperplasia led to progressive medial degeneration and TAAD. In addition to diminished contractile and synthetic functions, fate-mapped SMCs displayed increased proteolysis, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal clearance of extracellular matrix and apoptotic cells. SMCs acquired a limited repertoire of macrophage markers and functions via biogenesis of degradative organelles through an mTOR/β-catenin/MITF-dependent pathway, but were distinguishable from conventional macrophages by an absence of hematopoietic lineage markers and certain immune effectors even in the context of hyperlipidemia. Similar mTOR activation and induction of a degradative SMC phenotype in a model of mild TAAD due to Fbn1 mutation greatly worsened disease with near-uniform lethality. The finding of increased lysosomal markers in medial SMCs from clinical TAAD specimens with hyperplasia and matrix degradation further supports the concept that proliferation of degradative SMCs within the media causes aortic disease, thus identifying mTOR-dependent phenotypic modulation as a therapeutic target for combating TAAD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe target of rapamycin (TOR), in complex with the proteins raptor and LST8 (TOR complex 1), phosphorylates the p70S6K and 4E-BP1 to promote mRNA translation. Genetic evidence establishes that TOR complex activity in vivo requires the small GTPase Rheb, and overexpression of Rheb can rescue TOR from inactivation in vivo by amino-acid withdrawal. The Tuberous Sclerosis heterodimer (TSC1/TSC2) functions as a Rheb GTPase activator and inhibits TOR signaling in vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we show that Rheb binds to the TOR complex specifically, independently of its ability to bind TSC2, through separate interactions with the mTOR catalytic domain and with LST8. Rheb binding to the TOR complex in vivo and in vitro does not require Rheb guanyl nucleotide charging but is modulated by GTP and impaired by certain mutations (Ile39Lys) in the switch 1 loop. Nucleotide-deficient Rheb mutants, although capable of binding mTOR in vivo and in vitro, are inhibitory in vivo, and the mTOR polypeptides that associate with nucleotide-deficient Rheb in vivo lack kinase activity in vitro. Reciprocally, mTOR polypeptides bound to Rheb(Gln64Leu), a mutant that is nearly 90% GTP charged, exhibit substantially higher protein kinase specific activity than mTOR bound to wild-type Rheb.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe TOR complex 1 is a direct target of Rheb-GTP, whose binding enables activation of the TOR kinase.",

    "abstract": "Soy glycinin (11S) is involved in immune regulation. As an additive, sodium butyrate (SB) can relieve inflammation caused by 11S. To further delve into the mechanisms. A diet containing 50% fishmeal was the control group (FM group), and the experimental groups consisted of the FM group baseline plus 2% glycinin (GL group), 8% glycinin (GH group), and 8% glycinin + 0.13% sodium butyrate (GH-SB group). The specific growth ratio (SGR), feed utilization, and density of distal intestinal (DI) type II mucous cells were increased in the GL group. In the serum, IFN-γ was significantly upregulated in the GL group, and IgG and IL-1β were upregulated in the GH group. IgG, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the GH-SB group were significantly downregulated compared to those in the GH group. The mRNA levels of mTOR C1, mTOR C2, and Deptor were upregulated in the GL, GH, and GH-SB groups in the DI compared with those in the FM group, while the mRNA levels of mTOR C1 and Deptor in the GH group were higher than those in the GL and GH-SB groups. 4E-BP1, RICTOR, PRR5, MHC II, and CD4 were upregulated in the GH group. TSC1, mLST8, and NFY mRNA levels in the GL and GH-SB groups were upregulated compared with those in the FM and GH groups. Western blotting showed P-PI3KSer294/T-PI3K, P-AktSer473/T-Akt, and P-mTORSer2448/T-mTOR were upregulated in the GH group. Collectively, our results demonstrate that low-dose 11S could improve serum immune by secreting IFN-γ. The overexpression of IgG and IL-1β is the reason that high-dose 11S reduces serum immune function, and supplementing SB can suppress this overexpression. Low-dose 11S can block the relationship between PI3K and mTOR C2. It can also inhibit the expression of 4E-BP1 through mTOR C1. High-dose 11S upregulates 4E-BP2 through mTOR C1, aggravating intestinal inflammation. SB could relieve inflammation by blocking PI3K/mTOR C2 and inhibiting 4E-BP2. Generally speaking, the hybrid grouper obtained different serum and DI immune responses under different doses of 11S, and these responses were ultimately manifested in growth performance. SB can effectively enhance serum immunity and relieve intestinal inflammation caused by high dose 11S.",

    "issue": "69(10)",
    "pages": "4107-11",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer is complicated by the existence of a negative feedback loop linking mTOR to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Thus, mTOR inhibition by rapamycin or TSC1/2 results in increased PI3K-Akt activation. The death domain kinase receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) plays a key role in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and also activates the PI3K-Akt pathway through unknown mechanisms. RIP1 has recently been found to be overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, the most common adult primary malignant brain tumor, but not in grade II to III glioma. Our data suggest that RIP1 activates PI3K-Akt using dual mechanisms by removing the two major brakes on PI3K-Akt activity. First, increased expression of RIP1 activates PI3K-Akt by interrupting the mTOR negative feedback loop. However, unlike other signals that regulate mTOR activity without affecting its level, RIP1 negatively regulates mTOR transcription via a NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism. The second mechanism used by RIP1 to activate PI3K-Akt is down-regulation of cellular PTEN levels, which appears to be independent of NF-kappaB activation. The clinical relevance of these findings is highlighted by the demonstration that RIP1 levels correlate with activation of Akt in glioblastoma multiforme. Thus, our study shows that RIP1 regulates key components of the PTEN-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and elucidates a novel negative regulation of mTOR signaling at the transcriptional level by the NF-kappaB pathway. Our data suggest that the RIP1-NF-kappaB status of tumors may influence response to treatments targeting the PTEN-PI3K-mTOR signaling axis.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung-metastasizing neoplasm caused by the proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells that commonly carry loss-of-function mutations in either the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or 2 (TSC1 or TSC2) genes. While allosteric inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has shown substantial clinical benefit, complementary therapies are required to improve response and/or to treat specific patients. However, there is a lack of LAM biomarkers that could potentially be used to monitor the disease and to develop other targeted therapies. We hypothesized that the mediators of cancer metastasis to lung, particularly in breast cancer, also play a relevant role in LAM. Analyses across independent breast cancer datasets revealed associations between low TSC1/2 expression, altered mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway signaling, and metastasis to lung. Subsequently, immunohistochemical analyses of 23 LAM lesions revealed positivity in all cases for the lung metastasis mediators fascin 1 (FSCN1) and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1). Moreover, assessment of breast cancer stem or luminal progenitor cell biomarkers showed positivity in most LAM tissue for the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), integrin-ß3 (ITGB3/CD61), and/or the sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) proteins. The immunohistochemical analyses also provided evidence of heterogeneity between and within LAM cases. The analysis of Tsc2-deficient cells revealed relative over-expression of FSCN1 and ID1; however, Tsc2-deficient cells did not show higher sensitivity to ID1-based cancer inhibitors. Collectively, the results of this study reveal novel LAM biomarkers linked to breast cancer metastasis to lung and to cell stemness, which in turn might guide the assessment of additional or complementary therapeutic opportunities for LAM.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT\nSomatic mutations in the Med12 gene are known to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human uterine fibroids (UFs).\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine the role of vitamin D3 in the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in human UF cells.\n\n\nDESIGN\nImmortalized human UF cells (HuLM) and human primary UF (PUF) cells were treated with increasing concentrations of vitamin D3 and thereafter analyzed using Western blots and immunocytochemistry.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWnt/β-catenin and mTOR signaling proteins in cultured HuLM and PUF cells were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUF tumors with Med12 somatic mutations showed an up-regulation of Wnt4 and β-catenin as compared with adjacent myometrium. Vitamin D3 administration reduced the levels of Wnt4 and β-catenin in both HuLM and PUF cells. Vitamin D3 also reduced the expression/activation of mTOR signaling in both cell types. In contrast, vitamin D3 induced the expression of DNA damaged-induced transcription 4 (an inhibitor of mTOR) and tuberous sclerosis genes (TSC1/2) in a concentration-dependent manner in HuLM cells. Furthermore, we observed a concentration-dependent reduction of Wisp1 (Wnt induced signaling protein 1) and flap endonuclease 1 proteins in HuLM cells. Additionally, abrogation of vitamin D receptor expression (by silencing) in normal myometrial cells induces Wnt4/β-catenin as well as prompts a fibrotic process including an increase in cell proliferation and increased extracellular matrix production. Together these results suggest that vitamin D3 functions as an inhibitor of Wnt4/β-catenin and mTOR signaling pathways, which may play major roles in fibroid pathogenesis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVitamin D3 may have utility as a novel long-term therapeutic and/or preventive option for uterine fibroids.",

    "issue": "22()",
    "pages": "77-82",
    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are mesenchymal neoplasms with immunoreactivity for both melanocytic and smooth muscle markers. PEComas occur at multiple sites, and malignant PEComas can undergo metastasis, recurrence and aggressive clinical courses. Although the lung is a common metastatic site of PEComas, they usually appear as multiple nodules but rarely become cystic or cavitary. Here, we describe a female patient whose lungs manifested multiple cystic, cavity-like and nodular metastases 3 years after the resection of uterine tumors tentatively diagnosed as epithelioid smooth muscle tumors with uncertain malignant potential. This patient's subsequent pneumothorax necessitated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and examination of her resected lung specimens eventually led to correcting the diagnosis, i.e., to a PEComa harboring tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) loss-of-heterozygosity that originated in the uterus and then metastasized to the lungs. The administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue later stabilized her clinical course. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first in the literature that associates PEComas with a TSC1 abnormality. Additionally, the pulmonary manifestations, including imaging appearance and pneumothorax, somewhat resembled those of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a representative disease belonging to the PEComa family. Although PEComas are rare, clinicians, radiologists and pathologists should become aware of this disease entity, especially in the combined clinical setting of multiple cystic, cavity-like, nodular lesions on computed tomography of the chest and a past history of the tumor in the female reproductive system.",

    "title": "Insulin stimulates adipogenesis through the Akt-TSC2-mTORC1 pathway.",
    "issue": "4(7)",
    "pages": "e6189",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe signaling pathways imposing hormonal control over adipocyte differentiation are poorly understood. While insulin and Akt signaling have been found previously to be essential for adipogenesis, the relative importance of their many downstream branches have not been defined. One direct substrate that is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation is the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein, which associates with TSC1 and acts as a critical negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex results in constitutive mTORC1 signaling and, through mTORC1-dependent feedback mechanisms and loss of mTORC2 activity, leads to a concomitant block of Akt signaling to its other downstream targets.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nWe find that, despite severe insulin resistance and the absence of Akt signaling, TSC2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes display enhanced adipocyte differentiation that is dependent on the elevated mTORC1 activity in these cells. Activation of mTORC1 causes a robust increase in the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), which is the master transcriptional regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In examining the requirements for different Akt-mediated phosphorylation sites on TSC2, we find that only TSC2 mutants lacking all five previously identified Akt sites fully block insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling in reconstituted Tsc2 null cells, and this mutant also inhibits adipogenesis. Finally, renal angiomyolipomas from patients with tuberous sclerosis complex contain both adipose and smooth muscle-like components with activated mTORC1 signaling and elevated PPARgamma expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nThis study demonstrates that activation of mTORC1 signaling is a critical step in adipocyte differentiation and identifies TSC2 as a primary target of Akt driving this process. Therefore, the TSC1-TSC2 complex regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, at least in part, through its control of mTORC1 activity and PPARgamma expression.",

    "issue": "288(22)",
    "pages": "15687-98",
    "abstract": "Many factors, including duration and intensity of the unfolded protein response (UPR), dictate whether cells will adapt to endoplasmic reticulum stress or undergo apoptosis. In tuberous sclerosis (TSC), elevation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity has been proposed to compound the induction of UPR transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, suggesting that the UPR could be targeted to eradicate TSC1/2-null cells during patient therapy. Here we report that control of c-MYC translation by mTORC1 plays a key role in determining whether TSC2-null Elt3 rat leiomyoma cells apoptose in response to UPR induction by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Although bortezomib induces eukaryotic initiating factor 2α phosphorylation, mTORC1 activity was also required for downstream induction of the UPR transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP by a mechanism involving increased expression of c-MYC. Although bortezomib-induced c-MYC transcription was resistant to rapamycin treatment, mTORC1 activity was required for efficient c-MYC translation. c-MYC subsequently bound to the ATF4 promoter, suggesting direct involvement of an mTORC1/c-MYC-driven signaling pathway in the activation of the UPR. Consistent with this notion, exogenously expressed c-MYC reversed the ability of rapamycin to prevent bortezomib-induced CHOP and ATF4 expression as well as apoptosis. These findings indicate that the induction of ATF4/CHOP expression occurs via mTORC1 regulation of c-MYC and that this signaling pathway is a major determinant in the ability of bortezomib to induce apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Birt-Hogg-Dube' Syndrome (BHDS) is a rare genetic disorder in humans characterized by skin hamartomas, lung cysts, pneumothorax, and increased risk of renal tumors. BHDS is caused by mutations in the BHD gene, which encodes for Folliculin, a cytoplasmic adapter protein that binds to Folliculin interacting proteins-1 and -2 (Fnip1, Fnip2) as well as the master energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK). Whereas kidney-specific deletion of the Bhd gene in mice is known to result in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and renal cell carcinoma, the roles of Fnip1 in renal cell development and function are unclear. In this study, we utilized mice with constitutive deletion of the Fnip1 gene to show that the loss of Fnip1 is sufficient to result in renal cyst formation, which was characterized by decreased AMPK activation, increased mTOR activation, and metabolic hyperactivation. Using RNAseq, we found that Fnip1 disruption resulted in many cellular and molecular changes previously implicated in the development of PKD in humans, including alterations in the expression of ion and amino acid transporters, increased cell adhesion, and increased inflammation. Loss of Fnip1 synergized with Tsc1 loss to hyperactivate mTOR, increase Erk activation, and greatly accelerate the development of PKD. Our results collectively define roles for Fnip1 in regulating kidney development and function, and provide a model for how loss of Fnip1 contributes to PKD and perhaps renal cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Various neuropsychiatric features, including autism, are prevalent in TSC. Recently, significant progress has been possible with the prospective calculation of the prevalence of autism in TSC, identification of early clinical and neurophysiological biomarkers to predict autism, and investigation of different therapies to prevent autism in this high-risk population. The author provides a narrative review of recent findings related to biomarkers for diagnosis of autism in TSC, as well as recent studies related to the management of TSC-associated autism. Further sophisticated modeling and analysis are required to understand the role of different models-tuber models, seizures and related neurophysiological factors models, genotype models, and brain connectivity models-to unravel the neurobiological basis of autism in TSC. Early neuropsychologic assessments may be beneficial in this high-risk group. Targeted intervention to improve visual skill, cognition, and fine motor skills with later addition of social skill training can be helpful. Multicenter, prospective studies are ongoing to identify if presymptomatic treatment with vigabatrin in patients with TSC can improve outcomes, including autism. Several studies indicated reasonable safety of everolimus in young children, and its potential application in high-risk infants with TSC, before the closure of the temporal window of permanent changes, maybe undertaken shortly.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome whose manifestations can include seizures, mental retardation, autism, and tumors in the brain, retina, kidney, heart, and skin. The products of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, heterodimerize and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This review focuses on the genetic and biochemical basis of the renal and pulmonary manifestations of TSC, angiomyolipomas, and lymphangiomyomatosis, respectively. Genetic analyses of sporadic angiomyolipomas revealed that all three components (smooth muscle, vessels, and fat) derive from a common progenitor cell, indicating the ability of cells lacking tuberin to differentiate into multiple lineages. Other genetic studies showed that the benign smooth muscle cells of pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis have the ability to migrate to other organs. These findings suggest that tuberin and hamartin play a role in the regulation of cellular migration and differentiation. We have found that tuberin activates B-Raf kinase and p42/44 MAPK and that cells lacking tuberin have low levels of B-Raf activity. We hypothesize that aberrant B-Raf activity in angiomyolipomas leads to abnormal cellular differentiation and migration.",

Cilia can be affected by mTORC1 signaling, and ciliary deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine whether neuronal cilia are affected in TSC. We show that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. Using high-content image-based assays, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with ciliation in TSC1/2-deficient neurons. To investigate the mechanistic relationship between mTORC1 and cilia, we perform a phenotypic screen for mTORC1 inhibitors with TSC1/2-deficient neurons. We identify inhibitors of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that suppress mTORC1 through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 rescues ciliation through downregulation of Hsp27. Our study uncovers the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia due to loss of TSC1/2, and it provides broadly applicable platforms for studying TSC-related neuronal dysfunction.",

    "issue": "2(6)",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disease often associated with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism, and characterized by the presence of anatomical malformations in the brain as well as tumors in other organs. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a complex that inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Previous animal studies demonstrated that Tsc1 or Tsc2 loss of function in the developing brain affects the intrinsic development of neural progenitor cells, neurons, or glia. However, the interplay between different cellular elements during brain development was not previously investigated. In this study, we generated a novel mutant mouse line (NEX-Tsc2) in which the Tsc2 gene is deleted specifically in postmitotic excitatory neurons of the developing forebrain. Homozygous mutant mice failed to thrive and died prematurely, whereas heterozygous mice appeared normal. Mutant mice exhibited distinct neuroanatomical abnormalities, including malpositioning of selected neuronal populations, neuronal hypertrophy, and cortical astrogliosis. Intrinsic neuronal defects correlated with increased mTORC1 signaling, whereas astrogliosis did not result from altered intrinsic signaling, since these cells were not directly affected by the gene knockout strategy. All neuronal and non-neuronal abnormalities were suppressed by continuous postnatal treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001. The data suggest that the loss of Tsc2 and mTORC1 signaling activation in excitatory neurons not only disrupts their intrinsic development, but also disrupts the development of cortical astrocytes, likely through the mTORC1-dependent expression of abnormal signaling proteins. This work thus provides new insights into cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous functions of Tsc2 in brain development.",

    "issue": "28(21)",
    "pages": "5422-32",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a hamartoma syndrome attributable to mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 in which brain involvement causes epilepsy, mental retardation, and autism. We have reported recently (Meikle et al., 2007) a mouse neuronal model of TSC in which Tsc1 is ablated in most neurons during cortical development. We have tested rapamycin and RAD001 [40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin], both mammalian target of rapamycin mTORC1 inhibitors, as potential therapeutic agents in this model. Median survival is improved from 33 d to more than 100 d; behavior, phenotype, and weight gain are all also markedly improved. There is brain penetration of both drugs, with accumulation over time with repetitive treatment, and effective reduction of levels of phospho-S6, a downstream target of mTORC1. In addition, there is restoration of phospho-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3 levels in the treated mice, consistent with restoration of Akt function. Neurofilament abnormalities, myelination, and cell enlargement are all improved by the treatment. However, dysplastic neuronal features persist, and there are only modest changes in dendritic spine density and length. Strikingly, mice treated with rapamycin or RAD001 for 23 d only (postnatal days 7-30) displayed a persistent improvement in phenotype, with median survival of 78 d. In summary, rapamycin/RAD001 are highly effective therapies for this neuronal model of TSC, with benefit apparently attributable to effects on mTORC1 and Akt signaling and, consequently, cell size and myelination. Although caution is appropriate, the results suggest the possibility that rapamycin/RAD001 may have benefit in the treatment of TSC brain disease, including infantile spasms.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant multi system disorder. The genetic basis of the disorder is mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which leads to over activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein complex and results in development of benign tumors in different body systems such as brain, skin, lungs and kidney. The mTOR inhibitors are presently the main treatment option for patients with TSC. We here report a 21-year female patient with large bilateral angiomyolipoma (AML) in both kidneys with longest diameter more than 12.3 cm and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). Treatment with everolimus (EVE) was initiated at a dose of 10.0 mg/day and continued during the following 3 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before treatment with everolimus was initiated, and consequently at 12 and 36 months for follow-up of the efficacy of the treatment. After 3 years, the total size of largest AML decreased by ~24.0% in the longest diameter. A reduction of the total size of SEGA was also observed. The most common adverse effect of treatment was stomatitis grades 3 to 4 and one febrile episode associated with skin rash that required a reduced dose of EVE. In conclusion, the everolimus treatment improved even such a large renal AML and the effect persisted during the long-term administration with a small number of adverse effects. A positive effect was observed on the brain tumor as well.",

    "issue": "387(10)",
    "pages": "979-90",
    "abstract": "Hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer (HRMPC), which is metastatic and resistant to hormone therapy, is an intractable problem in clinical treatment. Anthraquinone-based natural products and synthetic compounds have shown anticancer activity. However, cardiac toxicity is a major adverse reaction in these compounds. CC-36, a unique anthraquinone derivative, displayed higher antiproliferative activity in HRMPC than that in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and normal prostate cells with the selectivity of five and twelve times, respectively. CC-36 caused G1 arrest of the cell cycle associated with an upregulation of p21 and downregulated levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expressions. Immunoprecipitation assay and Western blotting analysis showed that CC-36 triggered an increase of TSC1/TSC2 association and suppressed the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Ser2448) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) (Thr389), indicating the inhibition of both kinases' activities. CC-36 induced liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation at Thr189, leading to LKB1 translocation from nucleus to cytosol for AMPKα phosphorylation (Thr172) and the kinase activation. The signaling pathway was validated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique with LKB1 knockdown. The combination treatment of MK2206 (a specific Akt inhibitor) with CC-36 showed a synergistic apoptosis in PC-3 cells indicating a potential combination strategy for LKB1 activators. Taken together, the data suggest that CC-36 displays anti-HRMPC activity through the activation of LKB1-AMPK pathway, leading to an inhibition of mTOR signaling and the induction of G1 arrest of the cell cycle. The combination use of Akt inhibitors with agents acting through LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway is a potential strategy for HRMPC treatment.",

Interestingly, a growing number of case reports describe renal angiomyolipoma in BHD patients, suggesting a common molecular origin. The BHD-associated proteins FNIP1/2 and the TS protein Tsc1 were recently identified as regulators of the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Dysregulation of Hsp90 activity has previously been reported to support tumorigenesis, providing a potential explanation for the overlapping phenotypic manifestations in these two hereditary syndromes.",

    "issue": "27(12)",
    "pages": "3653-3665",
    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in glomerular podocytes leads to glomerular insufficiency and may contribute to the development of glomerular diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. Thus, an approach for preventing mTORC1 activation may allow circumvention of the onset and progression of mTORC1-dependent podocyte injury and glomerular diseases. mTORC1 activation requires inputs from both growth factors and nutrients that inactivate the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a key suppressor of mTORC1, on the lysosome. Previous studies in mice revealed that the growth factor-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and mTORC1 are essential for maintaining normal podocyte function, suggesting that direct inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway or mTORC1 may not be an ideal approach to sustaining physiologic podocyte functions under certain disease conditions. Here, we report the role of the Ragulator complex, which recruits mTORC1 to lysosomes in response to nutrient availability in podocytes. Notably, podocytes lacking Ragulator maintain basal mTORC1 activity. Unlike podocyte-specific mTORC1-knockout mice, mice lacking functional Ragulator in podocytes did not show abnormalities in podocyte or glomerular function. However, aberrant mTORC1 activation induced by active Rheb in podocyte-specific TSC1-knockout (podo-TSC1 KO) mice did require Ragulator. Moreover, ablation of Ragulator in the podocytes of podo-TSC1 KO mice or streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice significantly blocked the development of pathologic renal phenotypes. These observations suggest that the blockade of mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes may be a useful clinical approach to attenuate aberrant mTORC1 activation under certain disease conditions.",

    "issue": "23(18)",
    "pages": "3151-71",
    "abstract": "Cell growth (an increase in cell mass and size through macromolecular biosynthesis) and cell cycle progression are generally tightly coupled, allowing cells to proliferate continuously while maintaining their size. The target of rapamycin (TOR) is an evolutionarily conserved kinase that integrates signals from nutrients (amino acids and energy) and growth factors (in higher eukaryotes) to regulate cell growth and cell cycle progression coordinately. In mammals, TOR is best known to regulate translation through the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding proteins. Consistent with the contribution of translation to growth, TOR regulates cell, organ, and organismal size. The identification of the tumor suppressor proteins tuberous sclerosis1 and 2 (TSC1 and 2) and Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) has biochemically linked the TOR and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, providing a mechanism for the crosstalk that occurs between these pathways. TOR is emerging as a novel antitumor target, since the TOR inhibitor rapamycin appears to be effective against tumors resulting from aberrantly high PI3K signaling. Not only may inhibition of TOR be effective in cancer treatment, but rapamycin is an FDA-approved immunosuppressive and cardiology drug. We review here what is known (and not known) about the function of TOR in cellular and animal physiology.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) is characterized by exorbitant mTORC1 signalling and manifests as non-malignant, apoptosis-prone neoplasia. Previous reports have shown that TSC-/- cells are highly susceptible to mild, innocuous doses of genotoxic stress, which drive TSC-/- cells into apoptotic death. It has been argued that this hypersensitivity to stress derives from a metabolic/energetic shortfall in TSC-/- cells, but how metabolic dysregulation affects the DNA damage response and cell cycle alterations in TSC-/- cells exposed to genotoxic stress is not understood. We report here the occurrence of futile checkpoint responses and an unusual type of replicative stress (RS) in TSC1-/- fibroblasts exposed to low-dose genotoxins. This RS is characterized by elevated nucleotide incorporation rates despite only modest origin over-firing. Strikingly, an increased propensity for asymmetric fork progression and profuse chromosomal aberrations upon mild DNA damage confirmed that TSC loss indeed proved detrimental to stress adaptation. We conclude that low stress tolerance of TSC-/- cells manifests at the level of DNA replication control, imposing strong negative selection on genomic instability that could in turn detain TSC-mutant tumours benign.",

    "abstract": "The failure of axons to regenerate is a major obstacle for functional recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Removing extracellular inhibitory molecules results in limited axon regeneration in vivo. To test for the role of intrinsic impediments to axon regrowth, we analyzed cell growth control genes using a virus-assisted in vivo conditional knockout approach. Deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. In wild-type adult mice, the mTOR activity was suppressed and new protein synthesis was impaired in axotomized RGCs, which may contribute to the regeneration failure. Reactivating this pathway by conditional knockout of tuberous sclerosis complex 1, another negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, also leads to axon regeneration. Thus, our results suggest the manipulation of intrinsic growth control pathways as a therapeutic approach to promote axon regeneration after CNS injury.",

    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic syndrome and multisystem disease resulting in tumor formation in major organs. A molecular hallmark of TSC is a dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through loss-of-function mutations in either tumor suppressor TSC1 or TSC2. Here, we sought to identify drug vulnerabilities conferred by TSC2 tumor-suppressor loss through cell-based chemical biology screening. Our small-molecule chemical screens reveal a sensitivity to inhibitors of checkpoint kinase 1/2 (CHK1/2), regulators of cell cycle, and DNA damage response, in both in vitro and in vivo models of TSC2-deficient renal angiomyolipoma (RA) tumors. Further, we performed transcriptional profiling on TSC2-deficient RA cell models and discovered that these recapitulate some of the features from TSC patient kidney tumors compared to normal kidneys. Taken together, our study provides a connection between mTOR-dependent tumor growth and CHK1/2, highlighting the importance of CHK1/2 inhibition as a potential antitumor strategy in TSC2-deficient tumors.",

    "abstract": "The class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling network directs cellular metabolism and growth. Activation of mTORC1 [composed of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8(mLST8), 40-kDa proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40), and DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR)] depends on the Ras-related GTPases (Rags) and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) GTPase and requires signals from amino acids, glucose, oxygen, energy (ATP), and growth factors (including cytokines and hormones such as insulin). Here we discuss the signal transduction mechanisms through which growth factor-responsive PI3K signaling activates mTORC1. We focus on how PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and spatial regulation of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) complex (TSC complex) [composed of TSC1, TSC2, and Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16-1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7)] switches on Rheb at the lysosome, where mTORC1 is activated. Integration of PI3K- and amino acid-dependent signals upstream of mTORC1 at the lysosome is detailed in a working model. A coherent understanding of the PI3K-mTORC1 network is imperative as its dysregulation has been implicated in diverse pathologies including cancer, diabetes, autism, and aging.",

    "abstract": "PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an established oncogenic driver in humans. Targeted biologic agents against components of this pathway have shown promising activity leading to the approval of the allosteric inhibitors of mTOR, everolimus, and temsirolimus for the treatment of advanced cancers of the kidney, breast, and pancreas. Despite the established and promising activity of this therapeutic strategy, the duration and quality of benefit remains suboptimal in unselected patients. Improved understanding of the biologic consequence of altered PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is informing the development of protein (phosphorylated forms of S6, AKT, eIF4e) and genetic (PIK3CA mutation, PTEN loss of function, TSC1 and TSC2 mutation, PIK3CA-GS genetic profile) biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from this therapeutic strategy. This review provides an overview of the biologic rational and promising results of protein and genetic biomarkers for selecting patients appropriate for therapy with inhibitors of this pathway.",

    "pages": "5645-50",
    "abstract": "Disruption of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene leads to the development of tumors in multiple organs, most commonly affecting the kidney, brain, lung, and heart. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have identified a role for the tuberous sclerosis gene products in phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. On growth factor stimulation, tuberin, the TSC2 protein, is phosphorylated by Akt, thereby releasing its inhibitory effects on p70S6K. Here we demonstrate that primary tumors from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients and the Eker rat model of TSC expressed elevated levels of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effectors: p70S6K, S6 ribosomal protein, 4E-BP1, and eIF4G. In the Eker rat, short-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin was associated with a significant tumor response, including induction of apoptosis and reduction in cell proliferation. Surprisingly, these changes were not accompanied by significant alteration in cyclin D1 and p27 levels. Our data provide in vivo evidence that the mTOR pathway is aberrantly activated in TSC renal pathology and that treatment with rapamycin appears effective in the preclinical setting.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND INFORMATION\nMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell and whole-body energy homoeostasis. REV-ERBα is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in metabolism. While mTORC1 activation is necessary for muscle differentiation, the role of REV-ERBα is less clear.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe studied the effect of REV-ERBα overexpression and silencing as well as mTORC1 activation and inhibition on the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. mTOR, myogenin and REV-ERBα were induced during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. REV-ERBα was found to activate mTORC1 during the differentiation process even in the absence of the differentiation medium. This activation was presumably through the downregulation of the expression of TSC1, an mTORC1 inhibitor.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHerein we show that REV-ERBα promotes myoblasts differentiation via the activation of the mTORC1 signalling pathway.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nREV-ERBα modulation can activate mTORC1 signalling and promote myoblasts differentiation.",

    "issue": "60(6)",
    "pages": "1255-1265",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nPatients with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent malformations of cortical development (MCDs) associated with seizures display hyperperfusion and increased vessel density of the dysmorphic cortical tissue. Some studies have suggested that the vascular defect occurred independently of seizures. Here, we further examined whether hypervascularization occurs in animal models of global and focal MCD with and without seizures, and whether it is sensitive to the mTOR blocker, rapamycin, that is approved for epilepsy treatment in tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used two experimental models of mTOR-dependent MCD consisting of conditional transgenic mice containing Tsc1null cells in the forebrain generating a global malformation associated with seizures and of wild-type mice containing a focal malformation in the somatosensory cortex generated by in utero electroporation (IUE) that does not lead to seizures. Alterations in blood vessels and the effects of a 2-week-long rapamycin treatment on these phenotypes were assessed in juvenile mice.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlood vessels in both the focal and global MCDs of postnatal day 14 mice displayed significant increase in vessel density, branching index, total vessel length, and decreased tissue lacunarity. In addition, rapamycin treatment (0.5 mg/kg, every 2 days) partially rescued vessel abnormalities in the focal MCD model, but it did not ameliorate the vessel abnormalities in the global MCD model that required higher rapamycin dosage for a partial rescue.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nHere, we identified hypervascularization in mTOR-dependent MCD in the absence of seizures in young mice, suggesting that increased angiogenesis occurs during development in parallel to alterations in corticogenesis. In addition, a predictive functional outcome is that dysplastic neurons forming MCD will have better access to oxygen and metabolic supplies via their closer proximity to blood vessels. Finally, the difference in rapamycin sensitivity between a focal and global MCD suggest that rapamycin treatment will need to be titrated to match the type of MCD.",

    "abstract": "Tumor suppressor complex TSC1/TSC2 represents a key negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6 kinase 1 signaling. Mutational inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2, linked to a rare lung disease, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), manifests as neoplastic growth of smooth-muscle (SM)-like cells and cystic destruction of the lungs that induces loss of pulmonary function. However, the precise mechanisms of abnormal cell growth in LAM remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate increased signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear localization in SM-like cells in LAM lungs and in TSC2-null xenographic tumors. Treatment of TSC2-null tumors with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuated STAT3 expression and phosphorylation. Increased STAT3 level and activation were also observed in LAM-dissociated (LAMD) cell cultures compared with normal human bronchus fibroblasts (HBFs) from LAM patients. Although interferon (IFN)-gamma inhibited proliferation of HBFs, IFN-gamma treatment had little effect on proliferation of LAMD and TSC2-null cells. Re-expression of TSC2 or treatment with rapamycin inhibited IFN-gamma-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and synergized with IFN-gamma in inhibiting TSC2-null and LAMD cell proliferation. Reduction of STAT3 protein levels or activity using specific small interfering RNA or inhibitory peptide, respectively, decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in TSC2-null and LAMD cells and sensitized cells to growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of IFN-gamma. Collectively, our data demonstrate that STAT3 activation is required for proliferation and survival of cells with TSC2 dysfunction, that STAT3 impedes growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of IFN-gamma, and that TSC2- and rapamycin-dependent inhibition of STAT3 restores antiproliferative effects of IFN-gamma. Thus, STAT3 may provide a novel therapeutic target for diseases associated with TSC1/TSC2 dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant syndrome that presents with diverse and complex clinical features and involves multiple human systems. TSC-related neurological abnormalities and organ dysfunction greatly affect the quality of life and can even result in death in patients with TSC. It is widely accepted that most TSC-related clinical manifestations are associated with hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway caused by loss‑of‑function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Remarkable progress in basic and translational research has led to encouraging clinical advances. Although mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin/everolimus) demonstrate great potential in TSC management, two major concerns hamper their generalized application. One is the frequent manifestation of adverse events, such as stomatitis, infections, and menstrual disorders; and the other is the poor response in certain patients. Thus, indicators are required to effectively predict the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors. Herein, we have summarized the current utilization of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of TSC and focused on their efficacy and safety, in an attempt to provide a reference to guide the treatment of TSC.",

    "issue": "86(11)",
    "pages": "6315-22",
    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection significantly increases the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) plays a key role in insulin signaling, thus enabling metabolic regulation in mammalian cells. We have previously shown that HCV infection modulates phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of IRS-1. In this study, we further examined the status of total IRS-1 and the downstream regulation of the Akt pathway in understanding mTOR/S6K1 signaling using HCV genotype 2a (clone JFH1)-infected hepatocytes. Inhibition of IRS-1 expression was observed in HCV-infected hepatocytes compared to that in a mock-infected control. The status of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC-1/TSC-2) was significantly decreased after HCV infection of human hepatocytes, showing a modulation of the downstream Akt pathway. Subsequent study indicated an increased level of Rheb and mTOR expression in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Interestingly, the phosphoS6K1 level was higher in HCV-infected hepatocytes, suggesting a novel mechanism for IRS-1 inhibition. Ectopic expression of TSC-1/TSC-2 significantly recovered the IRS-1 protein expression level in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Further analyses indicated that HCV core protein plays a significant role in modulating the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway. Proteasome inhibitor MG 132 recovered IRS-1 and TSC1/2 expression, suggesting that degradation occurred via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. A functional consequence of IRS-1 inhibition was reflected in a decrease in GLUT4 protein expression and upregulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme PCK2 in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Together, these observations suggested that HCV infection activates the mTOR/S6K1 pathway in inhibiting IRS-1 function and perturbs glucose metabolism via downregulation of GLUT4 and upregulation of PCK2 for insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting mainly young women.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe respiratory manifestations are characterized by a progressive cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma. Extrapulmonary involvement includes benign renal tumours called angiomyolipomas and abdominal lymphatic masses called lymphangioleiomyomas. At the pathological level, the cellular proliferation found in LAM is in part due to the presence of mutations in the tumour suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex). These mutations lead to the activation of the mTOR pathway, which is currently the main therapeutic target. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus or everolimus have shown a beneficial effect on the decline in pulmonary function and a reduction of angiomyolipoma size, but are necessary in only some patients.\n\n\nPERSPECTIVES\nLAM cells have migratory properties mediated by the formation of new lymphatic vessels. They are also able to secrete metalloproteases, which enhance their invasiveness. Moreover, the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors by LAM cells suggests a possible role for sex hormones in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA better understanding of mTOR-independent mechanisms would allow the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "pages": "1665-1676",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is characterized by cellular and tissue dysplasia in several organs. With the advent of genetic and molecular techniques, mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes were discovered to be responsible for mTOR overactivation, which is the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis. TSC is a highly heterogenous clinical entity with variable presentations and severity of disease. The brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidneys, and lungs are commonly involved in this syndrome, with neurologic symptoms comprising a significant source of morbidity and mortality. In 2012, the diagnostic criteria for TSC were revised by the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus panel, and genetic testing was incorporated into the guidelines. Early detection of cardiac rhabdomyomas or TSC-associated skin lesions can suggest the diagnosis and underlie the importance of clinical vigilance. Animal studies have demonstrated the benefit of using mTOR inhibitors for various symptoms of TSC, and they have been successfully translated into clinical trials with significant improvement in symptom burden. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, renal angiomyolipomas, and epilepsy are the three FDA-approved indications in relation to TSC for the use of everolimus, which is a first generation mTOR inhibitor. Rapamycin has been FDA approved for lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Other TSC symptoms that could potentially benefit from this class of medication are currently under investigation. TSC constitutes a unique combination of protean physical symptoms and neurobehavioral abnormalities. TSC associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND), including intellectual disability, mood disorders, and autism spectrum disorder, represent significant challenges but remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. The TAND checklist is a useful tool for routine use in the clinical evaluation of TSC patients. A multidisciplinary treatment plan, based on the specific problems and needs of individuals, is the key to management of this genetic condition.

    "pages": "1671-1673",
    "abstract": "Liver-specific deletion of autophagy-related genes in mice leads to hepatomegaly, liver injury and spontaneous liver tumorigenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that p62/SQSTM1-mediated NFE2L2/Nrf2/(nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) activation plays a critical role in promoting liver injury and tumorigenesis in autophagy-defective livers. However, the mechanisms of how persistent NFE2L2 activation induces liver injury and tumorigenesis are unknown. In a recent study, it was found that deletion of Mtor (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) or Rptor/Raptor attenuates hepatomegaly and liver injury in young liver-specific atg5 knockout mice but accelerates liver tumorigenesis in old mice likely due to feedback AKT activation. Overall, these findings suggest that both hyper- and hypo-activation of MTOR are detrimental to the liver resulting in the development of liver tumors. A balanced MTOR activity is critical to maintain the normal physiological functions of the liver, and caution should be exercised when treating hepatocellular carcinomas using MTOR inhibitors.

    "title": "Advanced sporadic renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma: case report of an extraordinary response to sirolimus linked to TSC2 mutation.",
    "issue": "18(1)",
    "pages": "561",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRenal epithelioid angiomyolipomas (EAML) are rare tumors with aggressive behavior. EAML can be sporadic or develop within the tuberous sclerosis complex syndrome, where mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 genes (critical negative regulators of mTOR Complex 1) result in an increased activation of mTOR pathway. Optimal EAML treatment, including mTOR inhibitors, remains undetermined.\n\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nHere we present the case of a young adult with a renal EAML that after radical nephrectomy developed metastases, first in liver and then in lumbar vertebrae. After complete surgical resection of these lesions, liver recurrence was detected, this time with incomplete surgical resection. After finding a new liver lesion, systemic treatment with sirolimus started. The patient exhibited a complete and durable response to this drug, being disease free at the time of publication, after 36 months of treatment. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of MTOR, TSC1 and TSC2 genes in the primary tumor, metastasis and blood of the patient, revealed one inactivating TSC2 mutation (c.2739dup; p.K914*) in the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased TSC2 protein content and increased phospho-S6 in the tumor cells, demonstrating mTOR pathway activation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNGS on an EAML patient with an extraordinary response to sirolimus uncovered TSC2 inactivation as the mechanism for the response. This study supports NGS as a useful tool to identify patients sensitive to mTOR inhibitors and supports the treatment of malignant EAML with these drugs.",

    "issue": "7(1)",
    "pages": "138",
    "abstract": "The latent reservoir of HIV-1 presents a major barrier to viral eradication. The mechanism of the establishment and maintenance of the latent viral reservoir is not yet fully understood, which hinders the development of effective curative strategies. In this study, we identified two inhibitory genes, TSC1 and DEPDC5, that maintained HIV-1 latency by suppressing the mTORC1 pathway. We first adapted a genome-wide CRISPR screening approach to identify host factors required for HIV latency in a T-cell-based latency model and discovered two inhibitory genes, TSC1 and DEPDC5, which are potentially involved in HIV-1 latency. Knockout of either TSC1 or DEPDC5 led to enhanced HIV-1 reactivation in both a T-cell line (C11) and a monocyte cell line (U1), and this enhancement could be antagonized by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Further evaluation of the mechanism revealed that TSC1 suppresses AKT-mTORC1-S6 via downregulation of Rheb, whereas DEPDC5 inhibits AKT-mTORC1-S6 through RagA. Overall, both TSC1 and DEPDC5 negatively regulate the AKT-mTORC1 pathway, and thus their agonists could be used in the development of new therapeutic approaches for activating HIV-1 latency.",

    "title": "The landscape of molecular alterations in pancreatic and small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours.",
    "issue": "80(3)",
    "pages": "153-158",
    "abstract": "Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (GEP-NENs) arise throughout the gut and feature varying biological behaviour and malignant potential. GEP-NENs include two genetically different entities, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). NECs are characterized by a dismal prognosis and by distinctive TP53 and RB1 inactivation which sets them apart from NETs. The latter, conversely, have a wide spectrum of aggressiveness and molecular alterations. Knowledge on their biology has recently expanded thanks to high-throughput studies focused on two important groups of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms: pancreatic (PanNETs) and small intestinal (SiNETs) tumours. PanNETs have been among the most studied also due to genetic syndromes featuring their onset. Research stemming from this observation has uncovered the inactivation of MEN1, VHL, TSC1/2, and the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway as distinctive biological features of these neoplasms. Next-Generation Sequencing added information on the role of telomere lengthening via ATRX/DAXX inactivation in a fraction of PanNETs, while other display shortened telomeres and recurrent chromosomal alterations. The data so far disclosed a heterogeneous combination of driver events, yet converging into four pathways including DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, PI3K/mTOR signalling and telomere maintenance. SiNETs showed a lesser relationship with mutational driver events, even in the case of familial cases. High throughput studies identified putative driver mutations in CDKN1 and APC which, however, were reported in a minor fraction (∼10%) of cases. Tumorigenesis of SiNETs seems to depend more on chromosomal alterations (loss of chromosome 8, gains at 4, 5 and 20) and epigenetic events, which converge to hyperactivate the PI3K/mTOR, MAPK and Wnt pathways. While calling for further integrative studies, these data lay previous and recent findings in a more defined frame and provide clinical research with several candidate markers for patient stratification and companion diagnostics.",

    "issue": "17(6)",
    "pages": "631-8",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an often severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by overactivation of the mTOR pathway due to mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Seizures are the primary cause of neurologic morbidity and often refractory. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus was recently approved for the treatment of giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas in TSC. Whether everolimus has any direct effect on epilepsy in TSC is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWithin the framework of a compassionate use trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of everolimus in seven patients with TSC and intractable epilepsy. We evaluated seizure frequency, seizure-free days and adverse effects including standard laboratory parameters. Seizure frequency was analysed in each patient using a non-parametric test for trend and using a Generalized Estimating Equations Model in the total patient group. The observation period was continued for nine months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne patient discontinued the medication at the beginning of the observation period due to side effects (flushing). In the remaining 6 patients, we observed a reduction of seizures in 4/6 patients with a reduction of 25-100%. In addition, the percentage of seizure-free days increased in 3/4 of these patients. In 2/6 patients, no alteration of seizure frequency was noted. We observed an increase of mild infections and an increase of triglycerides and various liver function tests. We did not encounter life-threatening infections or other side effects of everolimus.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nIn some patients with TSC, everolimus may have an anticonvulsant effect with a reduction in seizure frequency and increase of seizure-free days. Everolimus was well tolerated, with adverse effects similar to those reported in previous studies.",

    "issue": "26(1)",
    "pages": "18",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes are essential for cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and survival. mTORC1 hyperactivation occurs in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). mTORC1 localizes to the surface of lysosomes, where Rheb activates it. However, mTOR was also found on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). Recent studies showed that the same inputs regulate ER-to-GA cargo transport and mTORC1 (e.g., the level of amino acids or energy status of the cell). Nonetheless, it remains unknown whether mTOR contributes to the regulation of cargo passage through the secretory pathway.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe retention using selective hooks (RUSH) approach was used to image movement of model cargo (VSVg) between the ER and GA in various cell lines in which mTOR complexes were inhibited. We also investigated VSVg trafficking in TSC patient fibroblasts.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that mTOR inhibition led to the overall enhancement of VSVg transport through the secretory pathway in PC12 cells and primary human fibroblasts. Also, in TSC1-deficient cells, VSVg transport was enhanced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAltogether, these data indicate the involvement of mTOR in the regulation of ER-to-GA cargo transport and suggest that impairments in exocytosis may be an additional cellular process that is disturbed in TSC.",

    "abstract": "Impairment of reciprocal social interaction is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder. Genetic disorders frequently accompany autism spectrum disorder, such as tuberous sclerosis complex caused by haploinsufficiency of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. Accumulating evidence implicates a relationship between autism spectrum disorder and signal transduction that involves tuberous sclerosis complex 1, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and mammalian target of rapamycin. Here we show behavioural abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorder and their recovery by the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex. In Tsc2(+/-) mice, we find enhanced transcription of multiple genes involved in mammalian target of rapamycin signalling, which is dependent on activated mammalian target of rapamycin signalling with a minimal influence of Akt. The findings indicate a crucial role of mammalian target of rapamycin signalling in deficient social behaviour in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex, supporting the notion that mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors may be useful for the pharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder associated with tuberous sclerosis complex and other conditions that result from dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin signalling.",

    "issue": "9(6)",
    "pages": "1143-55",
    "abstract": "Studies of the role of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins (TSC1/TSC2) in pathology have focused mainly on their capacity to regulate translation and cell growth, but their relationship with alterations of cellular structures and the cell cycle is not yet fully understood. The transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) domain-containing proteins are central players in structures and processes connected to the centrosome. Here, TACC3 interactome mapping identified TSC2 and 15 other physical interactors, including the evolutionary conserved interactions with ch-TOG/CKAP5 and FAM161B. TACC3 and TSC2 co-localize and co-purify with components of the nuclear envelope, and their deficiency causes morphological alterations of this structure. During cell division, TACC3 is necessary for the proper localization of phospho-Ser939 TSC2 at spindle poles and cytokinetic bridges. Accordingly, abscission alterations and increased frequency of binucleated cells were observed in Tacc3- and Tsc2-deficient cells relative to controls. In regulating cell division, TSC2 acts epistatically to TACC3 and, in addition to canonical TSC/mTOR signaling and cytokinetic associations, converges to the early mitotic checkpoint mediated by CHFR, consistently with nuclear envelope associations. Our findings link TACC3 to novel structural and cell division functions of TSC2, which may provide additional explanations for the clinical and pathological manifestations of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) disease and TSC syndrome, including the greater clinical severity of TSC2 mutations compared to TSC1 mutations.",

    "issue": "35(3)",
    "pages": "546-53",
    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer presents mostly with serous, endometrioid or mucinous histology but is treated as a single disease. The development of histotype-specific therapy has been challenging because of the relative lack of studies attributing disrupted pathways to a distinct histotype differentiation. mTOR activation is frequently associated with poor prognosis in serous ovarian cancer, which is the most common and most deadly histotype. However, the mechanisms dysregulating mTOR in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer are unknown. We detected copy number loss and correlated lower expression levels of LKB1, TSC1, TSC2 and PTEN tumor suppressor genes for upstream regulators of mTOR activity in up to 80% in primary ovarian serous tumor databases, with LKB1 allelic loss-predominant. Reduced LKB1 protein was usually associated with increased mTOR activity in both serous ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Conditional deletion of Lkb1 in murine ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells caused papillary hyperplasia and shedding but not tumors. Simultaneous deletion of Lkb1 and Pten, however, led to development of high-grade ovarian serous histotype tumors with 100% penetrance that expressed WT1, ERα, PAX8, TP53 and cytokeratin 8, typical markers used in the differential diagnosis of serous ovarian cancer. Neither hysterectomy nor salpingectomy interfered with progression of ovarian tumorigenesis, suggesting that neither uterine nor Fallopian tube epithelial cells were contributing to tumorigenesis. These results implicate LKB1 loss in the OSE in the pathogenesis of serous ovarian cancer and provide a compelling rationale for investigating the therapeutic potential of targeting LKB1 signaling in patients with this deadly disease.",

Thus far, two distinct molecular groups-classic PEComas with TSC mutations and TFE3-translocation associated PEComas with TFE3 fusions have been described. Recognition of the first group is imperative as these patients may benefit from targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors, if malignant. This review will focus on recognition of the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of PEComas, as well as the role of molecular testing in their diagnosis and treatment, analysis of the different algorithms to predict behavior, and differential diagnosis.",

It commonly causes several types of cystic disease and benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) in the kidneys that can both lead to significant premature loss of glomerular filtration rate. The main risks of angiomyolipomata, severe bleeding, loss of renal function, and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, can be ameliorated by active surveillance and preemptive therapy with mTOR inhibitors. The cystogenic mechanism may involve primary cilia, but also appears to also involve a majority of normal tubular cells and may be driven by a minority of cells with mutations inactivating both their TSC1 or TSC2 genes.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas distributed throughout the body, skin, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Two-thirds of patients represent sporadic mutations. The classic triad is seizures, mental retardation, and cutaneous angiofibromas. However, the full triad occurs in only 29% of patients; 6% of them lack all three of them. Two tumor suppressor genes responsible for TSC have been identified: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 and TSC2 on chromosome 16. This article highlights the most recent significant advances in the diagnosis and genetics of TSC, along with a discussion on the limitations and the usefulness of the revised 1998 clinical criteria for the tuberous sclerosis complex. The \"ash leaf\" macule often comes in other shapes, such as round; most are polygonal, usually 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm in diameter, resembling a thumbprint. Since the death of its describer, Thomas Fitzpatrick, we call each a \"Fitzpatrick patch.\" Special attention is paid in this work to TSC treatment options, including therapeutic trials with rapamycin, also known as sirolimus.\n\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVE\nAfter completing this learning activity, participants should familiar with tuberous sclerosis complex, its cutaneous signs and systemic findings stratified by patient age, its genetics, and the potential for meaningful therapeutic intervention.",

    "issue": "19(2)",
    "pages": "112-120",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an inherited tumor syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 that lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and development of tumors in multiple organs including the kidneys. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and everolimus (rapalogs) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating TSC-associated tumors including renal angiomyolipomas. However, tumor responses are usually only partial, and regrowth occurs after drug withdrawal. TSC-associated tumors are highly vascular, and TSC patients with renal angiomyolipomas have elevated levels of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and VEGFD. Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases including VEGF receptors and has been used to treat metastatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma in one case, but formal trials have not been undertaken. In this study, we investigated tumor angiogenesis and the therapeutic efficacy of everolimus in combination with sorafenib for renal tumors in Tsc2+/- mice. We found that these tumors exhibited remarkably variable angiogenesis despite consistent aberrant activation of mTOR and increased expression of HIF1α and VEGFA. Treatment of 11-month-old Tsc2+/- mice for 2 months with a combination of everolimus and sorafenib significantly reduced the number and size of solid renal tumors, whereas everolimus or sorafenib alone did not. These results suggest that inhibition of mTOR and multiple kinases including VEGF receptors using combination therapy could hold promise for the treatment of TSC-associated tumors that have responded inadequately to a rapalog alone.",

    "title": "Nutrient sensing in the mTOR/S6K1 signalling pathway.",
    "issue": "35(Pt 2)",
    "pages": "236-8",
    "abstract": "Nutrient overload induces constitutive S6K1 (S6 kinase 1) activation, which leads to insulin resistance by suppressing insulin-induced class I PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling [Um, Frigerio, Watanabe, Picard, Joaquin, Sticker, Fumagalli, Allegrini, Kozma, Auwerx and Thomas (2004) Nature 431, 200-205]. This finding gave rise to the question of the mechanism by which nutrients, such as AAs (amino acids), enter the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)/S6K1 signalling pathway. Counter to the prevailing view, our recent studies have shown that the AA input into the mTOR/S6K1 signalling pathway is not mediated by the tumour suppressor TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1)/TSC2 or its target, the proto-oncogene Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain). Instead, we found that the AA input was mediated by class 3 PI3K, or hVps34 (human vacuolar protein sorting 34). In brief, ectopic expression of hVps34 drives S6K1 activation, but only in the presence of AAs, and this effect is blocked by small interfering RNAs directed against hVps34. Moreover, stimulation of cells with AAs increases hVps34 activity, as indicated by the production of PI3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate). PI3P mediates the recruitment of proteins containing FYVE (Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p and EEA1) or PX (Phox homology) domains to endosomal membranes, with PI3P-rich micro-domains acting as signalling platforms. Additional evidence indicating hVps34 as the mediator of AA input to S6K1 came from experiments in which S6K1 activation was attenuated by ectopic expression of a cDNA containing two FYVE domains, which bind to PI3P, preventing binding of proteins containing either FYVE or PX domains [Nobukuni, Joaquin, Roccio, Dann, Kim, Gulati, Byfield, Backer, Natt, Bos, Zwartkruis and Thomas (2005) Proc.

    "issue": "53(1)",
    "pages": "129-140",
    "abstract": "Angiomyolipoma is the most common mesenchymal tumour of the kidney, even if for a long time it has been viewed as a hamartoma rather than a neoplasm. It belongs to a family of neoplasms, named PEComa, characterised by the constant presence of perivascular epithelioid cells that co-express smooth muscle and melanogenesis markers. Angiomyolipoma can occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis, a hereditary syndrome due to the alteration of TSC1 or TSC2 genes, or sporadically. Angiomyolipoma and its variants are indolent tumours; however, some epithelioid angiomyolipomas/pure epithelioid PEComas are aggressive, and criteria for malignancy have been proposed to identify those cases. Although typical angiomyolipoma is a straightforward diagnosis, pathologists should be aware of the wide morphological spectrum of its variants which could be tricky in routine clinical practice and could require immunohistochemical analysis for resolution. The differential diagnosis may range from an inflammatory process (for instance xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis) to the most common renal cancers and sarcomas. The immunoexpression of melanogenesis markers (HMB45 and Melan-A) and cathepsin K is extremely helpful in the majority of cases. Recently, a subset of epithelioid angiomyolipoma/pure epithelioid PEComa harbouring TFE3 gene fusions has been described, raising questions about its relationship with the family of perivascular epithelioid cell tumour. The activation of the mTOR pathway due to genetic alterations of tuberous sclerosis complex in TSC1 or TSC2 genes in angiomyolipoma has also been reported as well as the subsequent therapeutic implications.",

    "issue": "74(4)",
    "pages": "1067-78",
    "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the cancers of fastest-rising incidence in the world. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is overexpressed in melanoma and other cancers, and previous data suggest that iNOS and nitric oxide (NO) drive survival and proliferation of human melanoma cells. However, specific mechanisms through which this occurs are poorly defined. One candidate is the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which plays a major role in proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of melanoma and other cancers. We used the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay to test the hypothesis that melanoma growth is regulated by iNOS-dependent mTOR pathway activation. Both pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA-mediated gene silencing of iNOS suppressed melanoma proliferation and in vivo growth on the CAM in human melanoma models. This was associated with strong downregulation of mTOR pathway activation by Western blot analysis of p-mTOR, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p-P70S6K), p-S6RP, and p-4EBP1. iNOS expression and NO were associated with reversible nitrosylation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 2, and inhibited dimerization of TSC2 with its inhibitory partner TSC1, enhancing GTPase activity of its target Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a critical activator of mTOR signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from stage III melanoma patients showed a significant correlation between iNOS expression levels and expression of the mTOR pathway members. Exogenously supplied NO was also sufficient to reverse the mTOR pathway inhibition by the B-Raf inhibitor vemurafenib. In summary, covalent modification of TSC2 by iNOS-derived NO is associated with impaired TSC2/TSC1 dimerization, mTOR pathway activation, and proliferation of human melanoma. This model is consistent with the known association of iNOS overexpression and poor prognosis in melanoma and other cancers.",

    "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION\nHow does biochemical stimulation or inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway affect the activation and the growth of human primordial follicles in vitro?\n\n\nSUMMARY ANSWER\nThe PI3K/Akt activators act synergistically with the Hippo signaling pathway, disrupted by tissue fragmentation, to accelerate primordial follicles recruitment while mTORC1 inhibitor partially prevents the massive spontaneous activation.\n\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\nHippo disruption caused by ovarian fragmentation and exposure to PI3K/Akt activators have been successfully used to activate resting follicles prior to grafting in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency. Outside this indication, massive and premature activation is considered deleterious as it leads to the depletion of the follicular pool and developmental defects in vitro.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nOne hundred and twelve frozen-thawed ovarian cortex fragments from four patients were exposed to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-control group), everolimus (inhibitor group) or bpV (HOpic) and 740Y-P (activators group) during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively, and cultured for additional 5 days.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\nThe ovarian fragments (4×2×1 mm3) were analyzed at Days 0, 1, 3 and 5 of culture. Cortex were either directly processed for immunohistological or western blot analysis or subjected to follicular isolation for assessment of gene expression. The follicle number and the developmental stage were evaluated in sections of ovarian fragments to assess the early follicular development. Survival and developmental potential were evaluated using TUNEL labeling, GDF9 and Ki67 immunostainings, Kit ligand mRNA relative expression and measurement of 17β-estradiol (E2) levels in the culture medium. qPCR and western blotting were used to explore the expression of PI3K/Akt and Hippo pathways (TSC1, mTOR, LATS1, BIRC1 and CCN2 genes and PTEN/p-PTEN, Akt/p-Akt and rpS6/p-rps6 proteins), and localization of YAP in human ovarian tissue was performed by immunofluorescence.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nAround 80% of the follicles spontaneously activated during the culture period, triggered by the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Moreover, ovarian fragmentation immediately promoted translocation of the Hippo effector YAP into the nucleus of granulosa cells, leading to upregulation of BIRC1 and CCN2 downstream targets at Day 0 and an increase of follicular growth near the cutting site. Short term exposure of thawed human ovarian fragments to PI3K/Akt activators had significant (P < 0.05 at D1 and D3; P < 0.001 at D6) but limited and potentially negative effects on follicular activation compared to spontaneous follicular growth as suggested by impaired E2 secretion. In contrast, transient incubation with an mTORC1 inhibitor partially prevented spontaneous activation by limiting growing follicle counts (P < 0.01 at D6), granulosa cell proliferation, and Kit ligand expression while ensuring appropriate steroidogenesis.\n\n\nLARGE SCALE DATA\nN/A.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nImpact of in vitro culture might cover up the potential benefit of the everolimus on growing follicles morphology after 6 days.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nOur results demonstrate the synergistic effects of Hippo and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, contributing to the acceleration of early primordial follicle recruitment in thawed human ovarian fragments, and suggest a beneficial effect of the mTORC1 inhibitor.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Fond National de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (Grant Télevie Nos. 7.6516.16 F and 7.4578.14 F) and the Fonds Erasme.

    "issue": "58(1)",
    "pages": "581-589",
    "abstract": "Context: Shuxuening injection (SXNI), derived from the leaf of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae), is widely used to treat cardio-cerebral vascular system related disease due to the efficacy of dilating the blood vessels and improving the function of microcirculation. Nevertheless, SXNI induces immediate hypersensitivity reactions in clinics and the molecular mechanisms are unknown.Objective: The present study investigates the molecular mechanism of SXNI mediated hypersensitivity reactions.Materials and methods: Naive male ICR mice (n = 10) were administered (i.v.) with negative control combined with Evans blue (EB) (CTL-EB), SXNI (14 or 70 mg/kg) combined with EB (SXNI/1-EB or SXNI/4-EB), vascular leakage was evaluated, ears and lungs were collected for histopathological analysis. In vitro, TSC1 was knockdown in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were incubated with SXNI, and the alterations of endothelial cell permeability were observed. Rapamycin (mTOR inbibitor) was used to investigate SXNI-induced hypersensitivity reactions both in mice and HUVECs.Results: SXNI (70 mg/kg) induced vascular leakage in mice. Slight oedema and microvascular dilation in the ears, and broaden of alveolar septal and monocyte infiltration in the lungs were observed in SXNI (70 mg/kg) treated mice. mTOR inhibitor alleviates SXNI mediated vascular endothelial hyperpermeability both in vitro and in vivo.Discussion and conclusions: SXNI stimulates pseudo-allergic reactions through hyperactivation of mTOR signalling pathway. Our work provides the new molecular mechanism of drug related pseudo-allergic reactions, and a potential drug to prevent and treat SXNI mediated hypersensitivity reactions.",

    "issue": "3(10)",
    "pages": "e3581",
    "abstract": "The Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) disease is a genetic cancer syndrome. The responsible gene, BHD, has been identified by positional cloning and thought to be a novel tumor suppressor gene. BHD mutations cause many types of diseases including renal cell carcinomas, fibrofolliculomas, spontaneous pneumothorax, lung cysts, and colonic polyps/cancers. By combining Gateway Technology with the Ksp-Cre gene knockout system, we have developed a kidney-specific BHD knockout mouse model. BHD(flox/flox)/Ksp-Cre mice developed enlarged kidneys characterized by polycystic kidneys, hyperplasia, and cystic renal cell carcinoma. The affected BHD(flox/flox)/Ksp-Cre mice died of renal failure at approximate three weeks of age, having blood urea nitrogen levels over tenfold higher than those of BHD (flox/+)/Ksp-Cre and wild-type littermate controls. We further demonstrated that these phenotypes were caused by inactivation of BHD and subsequent activation of the mTOR pathway. Application of rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR activity, to the affected mice led to extended survival and inhibited further progression of cystogenesis. These results provide a correlation of kidney-targeted gene inactivation with renal carcinoma, and they suggest that the BHD product FLCN, functioning as a cyst and tumor suppressor, like other hamartoma syndrome-related proteins such as PTEN, LKB1, and TSC1/2, is a component of the mTOR pathway, constituting a novel FLCN-mTOR signaling branch that regulates cell growth/proliferation.",

    "issue": "8(393)",
    "pages": "rs9",
    "abstract": "The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) family of tumor suppressors, TSC1 and TSC2, function together in an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that is a point of convergence for major cell signaling pathways that regulate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Mutation or aberrant inhibition of the TSC complex is common in various human tumor syndromes and cancers. The discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to selectively target cells with functional loss of this complex is therefore of clinical relevance to patients with nonmalignant TSC and those with sporadic cancers. We developed a CRISPR-based method to generate homogeneous mutant Drosophila cell lines. By combining TSC1 or TSC2 mutant cell lines with RNAi screens against all kinases and phosphatases, we identified synthetic interactions with TSC1 and TSC2. Individual knockdown of three candidate genes (mRNA-cap, Pitslre, and CycT; orthologs of RNGTT, CDK11, and CCNT1 in humans) reduced the population growth rate of Drosophila cells lacking either TSC1 or TSC2 but not that of wild-type cells. Moreover, individual knockdown of these three genes had similar growth-inhibiting effects in mammalian TSC2-deficient cell lines, including human tumor-derived cells, illustrating the power of this cross-species screening strategy to identify potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in regulating cancer initiation and progression. In this study, two miRNAs, miR-25 and -32, are identified as p53-repressed miRNAs by p53-dependent negative regulation of their transcriptional regulators, E2F1 and MYC. However, miR-25 and -32 result in p53 accumulation by directly targeting Mdm2 and TSC1, which are negative regulators of p53 and the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, respectively, leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation through cell cycle arrest. Thus, there is a recurrent autoregulatory circuit involving expression of p53, E2F1, and MYC to regulate the expression of miR-25 and -32, which are miRNAs that, in turn, control p53 accumulation. Significantly, overexpression of transfected miR-25 and -32 in glioblastoma multiforme cells inhibited growth of the glioblastoma multiforme cells in mouse brain in vivo. The results define miR-25 and -32 as positive regulators of p53, underscoring their role in tumorigenesis in glioblastoma.",

    "issue": "11(11)",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) is one of the most serious factors to negatively affect the lactation performance of dairy cows. Bovine mammary epithelial cells are important for lactation. It was demonstrated that HS decreases the lactation performance of dairy cows, partly through altering gene expression within bovine mammary epithelial tissue. However, the cellular metabolism mechanisms under HS remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether HS induced changes in intracellular metabolites and gene transcription related to amino acid metabolism, amino acid transportation and the mTOR signaling pathway. Immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell lines (MAC-T cells, n = 5 replicates/treatment) were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C (Control group) and 42 °C (HS group). Relative to the control group, HS led to a greater mRNA expression of heat shock protein genes HSF1, HSPB8, HSPA5, HSP90AB1 and HSPA1A. Compared with the control group, metabolomics using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry identified 417 differential metabolites with p < 0.05 and a variable importance in projection (VIP) score >1.0 in the HS group. HS resulted in significant changes to the intracellular amino acid metabolism of glutathione, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, arginine, proline, cysteine, methionine, alanine, aspartate and glutamate. HS led to a greater mRNA expression of the amino acid transporter genes SLC43A1, SLC38A9, SLC36A1, and SLC3A2 but a lower mRNA expression of SLC7A5 and SLC38A2. Additionally, HS influenced the expression of genes associated with the mTOR signaling pathway and significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of mTOR, AKT, RHEB, eIF4E and eEF2K but decreased the mRNA expression of TSC1, TSC2 and eEF2 relative to the control group. Compared with the control group, HS also led to greater mRNA expression of the CSN1S2 gene. Overall, our study indicates that bovine mammary epithelial cells may have the ability to resist HS damage and continue milk protein synthesis partly through enhanced intracellular amino acid absorption and metabolism and by activating the mTOR signaling pathway during HS.",

    "abstract": "A number of recently described renal tumor entities share an eosinophilic/oncocytic morphology, somewhat solid architectural growth pattern, and tendency to present as low-stage tumors. The vast majority of such tumors follow a non-aggressive clinical behavior. In this review, we discuss the morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic profiles of the three most recent novel/emerging renal entities associated with TSC/mTOR pathway mutations. These are eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic vacuolated tumors, and low-grade oncocytic tumors, which belong to a heterogeneous group of renal tumors, demonstrating mostly solid architecture, eosinophilic/oncocytic cytoplasm, and overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical features between renal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. All three tumors also share a molecular genetic background with mutations in the mTORC1 pathway (TSC1/TSC2/mTOR/RHEB). Despite the common genetic background, it appears that the tumors with TSC/mTOR mutations represent a diverse group of distinct renal neoplasms.",

    "issue": "107(2)",
    "pages": "414-422",
    "abstract": "Nanoparticulate titanium dioxide (nano TiO2 ) is extensively applied in biological tissue engineering materials, food additives, cosmetics, and sunscreens. Numerous studies to date have demonstrated that nano TiO2 penetrates through the digestive system and possibly the blood circulation, leading to accumulation in the ovary and consequent reproductive toxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of nano TiO2 on the female reproductive system remain to be established. In this study, female mice were exposed to different doses of nano TiO2 (1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg body weight) via intragastric administration for 60 consecutive days, followed by investigation of follicular development, regulation of TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways, and expression of the pathway components. Subchronic exposure to nano TiO2 induced a decrease in the number of primordial, secondary, and antral follicles and corpus luteum and concomitant increase in atretic follicles. Furthermore, follicular development disorder induced by nano TiO2 was associated with upregulation of TGF-β1, TGF-βR1, PTEN, and Foxo3a involved in cell growth and apoptosis and downregulation of several growth factors (PI3K, AKT, p-mTOR, p70S6K, p-p70S6K1, rpS6, p-rpS6, TSC1, and TSC2) in mouse ovaries. Our data collectively implied that suppression of ovarian follicle development by nano TiO2 was triggered by dysfunction of the TGF-β, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and AKT/p70S6K-rpS6/TSC/mTOR pathways. The adverse effects of nano TiO2 on follicular development highlights the necessity for caution in the use of nanomaterials in the food industry. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "pages": "56",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by multiple symptoms including neuropsychological deficits such as seizures, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which enhance activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Recent studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reverse TSC-associated deficits in rodent models of TSC. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors toward the psychiatric symptoms associated with TSC. Here, we report a case study of a Korean patient with TSC, who exhibited multiple symptoms including frequent seizures, intellectual disability, language delays, and social problems. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2. Expressing the novel deletion mutant in HEK293T cells significantly increased mTOR pathway activation. Furthermore, everolimus treatment showed not only reduction in SEGA size, but dramatically improved behavioral deficits including autism related behaviors in the patient. In summary, we identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2 associated with severe TSC in a Korean family that enhances the activation of mTOR signaling in vitro. Everolimus treatment improved behavioral deficits in the patient.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder arising from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The resulting over-activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway leaves patients with TSC susceptible to the growth of non-malignant tumours in multiple organs. Previously, surgery was the main therapeutic option for TSC. However, pharmacological therapy with mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and sirolimus is now emerging as an alternate approach. Everolimus and sirolimus have already been shown to be effective in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and renal angiomyolipoma (AML), and everolimus is currently being evaluated in treating TSC-related epilepsy. In November 2013 a group of European experts convened to discuss the current options and practical considerations for treating various manifestations of TSC. This article provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of SEGA, TSC-related epilepsy and renal AML, with a focus on where mTOR inhibitor therapy may be considered alongside other treatment options. Safety considerations regarding mTOR inhibitor therapy are also reviewed. With evidence of beneficial effects in neurological and non-neurological TSC manifestations, mTOR inhibitors may represent a systemic treatment for TSC.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an essential component for angiogenesis, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which controls the switch of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, activates the transcription of VEGF. 12-Deoxyphorbol 13-palmitate (DP) is a compound isolated from the roots of Euphorbia fischeriana, and has been revealed to possess anticancer activity. In the present study, we found that DP is an effective inhibitor of VEGF and HIF-1α in MCF-7 cells. DP markedly reduced cell viability as determined by MTT assay. ELISA, western blotting and RT-qPCR assays indicated that DP significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expression of VEGF and the protein expression of HIF-1α, while HIF-1α mRNA remained unchanged. In addition, the entrance of HIF-1α into the nucleus was blocked after DP treatment as detected by immunofluorescence analysis. In a further study, we proved that the effects mentioned above were associated with constitutive interference of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. DP effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K and its downstream factors p-Akt and p-mTOR, oppositely enhanced the expression of TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), which could be reversed by the co-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Moreover, the addition of wortmanin further downregulated the protein levels of VEGF and HIF-1α. The results revealed that DP inhibited the expression of VEGF and HIF-1α through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, confirming that DP may be a potential therapeutic candidate for breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop hamartomas containing biallelic inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Hamartomas overgrow epithelial and mesenchymal cells in TSC skin. The pathogenetic mechanisms for these changes had not been investigated, and the existence or location of cells with biallelic mutations (\"two-hit\" cells) was unclear. We compared TSC skin hamartomas (angiofibromas and periungual fibromas) with normal-appearing skin of the same patient, and we observed more proliferation and mTOR activation in hamartoma epidermis. Two-hit cells were not detected in the epidermis. Fibroblast-like cells in the dermis, however, exhibited allelic deletion of TSC2, in both touch preparations of fresh tumor samples and cells grown from TSC skin tumors, suggesting that increased epidermal proliferation and mTOR activation were not caused by second-hit mutations in the keratinocytes but by mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. Gene expression arrays, used to identify potential paracrine factors released by mesenchymal cells, revealed more epiregulin mRNA in fibroblast-like angiofibroma and periungual fibroma cells than in fibroblasts from normal-appearing skin of the same patient. Elevation of epiregulin mRNA was confirmed with real-time PCR, and increased amounts of epiregulin protein were demonstrated with immunoprecipitation. Epiregulin stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vitro. These results suggest that hamartomatous TSC skin tumors are induced by paracrine factors released by two-hit cells in the dermis and that proliferation with mTOR activation of the overlying epidermis is an effect of epiregulin.",

    "issue": "17(1)",
    "pages": "34",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCryptotanshinone (CPT), a fat-soluble phenanthraquinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been demonstrated to inhibit phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a couple of direct downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), resulting in cancer cell arrested in G0 phase and subsequent inhibition of proliferation. However, its concrete molecular mechanism about how CPT inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway is unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\none solution was used to check cell viability and western blotting for determining expression of the indicated proteins. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding of CPT with mTOR. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was to analyze whether CPT could disrupt the mTORC1 and TSC1/TSC2 complex. Recombinant adenoviral dominant-negative AMPKα was used to downregulate expression of AMPKα and lentiviral AMPK and TSC2 to silence the AMPK and TSC2 in Rh30 cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrimarily, Rh30 cells expressing rapamycin-resistant mutant mTOR are also sensitive to CPT, while the molecular docking result for CPT binding to mTOR is negative, suggesting that CPT inhibition of mTORC1 is different from rapamycin. Then the related proteins of PTEN-PI3K pathway was proved not to be affected, but the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by a concentration- and time- dependent manner, meaning that it may be associated with AMPK. Further results indicated that compound C, inhibitor of AMPK, could clearly reversed CPT inhibitory effect on Rh30 cells, and dominant-negative AMPK in cancer cells conferred resistance to CPT inhibition of 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1, as well as sh-AMPK. Furthermore, compared with AMPK-positive MEF cells, AMPK-negative MEF cells are less sensitive to CPT by the findings that 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1 express comparatively more. Additionally, phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) was activated under the treatment of CPT, and down-expression of TSC2 by shRNA slightly recovered expression of 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1, while co-immunoprecipitation of TSC2 did not alter expression of TSC1 by CPT.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCPT inhibiting mTORC1 pathway was mostly due to activation of AMPK-TSC2 axis rather than specific binding to mTORC1. CPT is a potent anticancer agent targeting AMPK.",

    "issue": "53(7)",
    "pages": "1119-30",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway regulates cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism. Loss-of-function mutations in upstream regulators of mTOR have been highly associated with dysplasias, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental disorders. These include tuberous sclerosis, which is due to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes; mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as in Cowden syndrome, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (PMSE) due to mutations in the STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRADalpha); and neurofibromatosis type 1 attributed to neurofibromin 1 mutations. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin may prevent epilepsy and improve the underlying pathology in mouse models with disrupted mTOR signaling, due to PTEN or TSC mutations. However the timing and duration of its administration appear critical in defining the seizure and pathology-related outcomes. Rapamycin application in human cortical slices from patients with cortical dysplasias reduces the 4-aminopyridine-induced oscillations. In the multiple-hit model of infantile spasms, pulse high-dose rapamycin administration can reduce the cortical overactivation of the mTOR pathway, suppresses spasms, and has disease-modifying effects by partially improving cognitive deficits. In post-status epilepticus models of temporal lobe epilepsy, rapamycin may ameliorate the development of epilepsy-related pathology and reduce the expression of spontaneous seizures, but its effects depend on the timing and duration of administration, and possibly the model used. The observed recurrence of seizures and epilepsy-related pathology after rapamycin discontinuation suggests the need for continuous administration to maintain the benefit. However, the use of pulse administration protocols may be useful in certain age-specific epilepsy syndromes, like infantile spasms, whereas repetitive-pulse rapamycin protocols may suffice to sustain a long-term benefit in genetic disorders of the mTOR pathway. In summary, mTOR dysregulation has been implicated in several genetic and acquired forms of epileptogenesis. The use of mTOR inhibitors can reverse some of these epileptogenic processes, although their effects depend upon the timing and dose of administration as well as the model used.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies. Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival. Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex. In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings. With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006). Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated. The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016. The results will be anticipated in 2017.",

    "abstract": "TSC1 and TSC2 are genes mutated in the syndrome TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex). We describe a 3-generation family with 17 affected members, all presenting classic TSC features except renal manifestations. The disease segregates with a silent substitution in TSC2, c.4149C>T, p.(Ser1383Ser), which leads to the formation of an active donor splice site, resulting in three shorter alternatively spliced transcripts with premature stop codons. However a small amount of normal spliced transcript is apparently produced from the mutated allele, which might explain the milder phenotype. The gene products of TSC1/2 form a complex which at energy limiting states, down-regulates the activity of the regulator of protein synthesis, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1). As expected, in contrast to cultured control fibroblasts, starvation of cultured patient fibroblasts obtained from a hypomelanotic macule did not lead to repression of mTORC1, whereas partial repression was observed in patient fibroblasts obtained from non-lesional skin. The findings indicate that the development of hypomelanotic macules is associated with constitutive activated mTORC1, whereas mild deregulation of mTORC1 allows the maintenance of normal skin. Furthermore, the finding establishes the pathogenic effect of the \"silent\" c.4149C>T substitution and emphasizes the need for awareness when interpreting silent substitutions in general.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable biologic plausibility to the hypothesis that genetic variability in pathways involved in insulin signaling and energy homeostasis may modulate dietary risk associated with colorectal cancer. We utilized data from 2 population-based case-control studies of colon (n = 1,574 cases, 1,970 controls) and rectal (n = 791 cases, 999 controls) cancer to evaluate genetic variation in candidate SNPs identified from 9 genes in a candidate pathway: PDK1, RP6KA1, RPS6KA2, RPS6KB1, RPS6KB2, PTEN, FRAP1 (mTOR), TSC1, TSC2, Akt1, PIK3CA, and PRKAG2 with dietary intake of total energy, carbohydrates, fat, and fiber. We employed SNP, haplotype, and multiple-gene analysis to evaluate associations. PDK1 interacted with dietary fat for both colon and rectal cancer and with dietary carbohydrates for colon cancer. Statistically significant interaction with dietary carbohydrates and rectal cancer was detected by haplotype analysis of PDK1. Evaluation of dietary interactions with multiple genes in this candidate pathway showed several interactions with pairs of genes: Akt1 and PDK1, PDK1 and PTEN, PDK1 and TSC1, and PRKAG2 and PTEN. Analyses show that genetic variation influences risk of colorectal cancer associated with diet and illustrate the importance of evaluating dietary interactions beyond the level of single SNPs or haplotypes when a biologically relevant candidate pathway is examined.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutation in one of the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2 is associated with several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). As an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, E/I ratio is believed to contribute to the development of these disorders, we investigated synaptic transmission during the first postnatal month using the Tsc2+/- mouse model. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in acute brain slices of medial prefrontal cortex. E/I ratio at postnatal day (P) 15-19 is increased in Tsc2+/- mice as compared with wildtype (WT). At P25-30, facilitated GABAergic transmission reduces E/I ratio to the WT level, but weakening of tonic GABAB receptor (GABABR)-mediated inhibition in Tsc2+/- mice leads to hyperexcitability both at single cell and neuronal network level. Short (1 h) preincubation of P25-30 Tsc2+/- slices with baclofen restores the GABABR-mediated inhibition and reduces network excitability. Interestingly, the same treatment at P15-19 leads to weakening of GABABR-mediated inhibition. We hypothesize that a dysfunction of tonic GABABR-mediated inhibition might contribute to the development of ASD symptoms and suggest that GABABR activation within an appropriate time window may be considered as a therapeutic target in ASD.",

Many signaling molecules such as FoxOs, ATM, mTOR, TSC1, Bmi1 and AKT play a significant role in ROS-induced HSC senescence. The roles of p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways can induce hematopoietic dysfunction and lead to ROS-induced HSC senescence.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nRecent publications evaluating cytoreductive nephrectomy in the era of targeted therapy emphasize the importance of patient selection. We reviewed the predictive role of genetic alterations in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nStudies evaluating the association between genetic alterations and outcomes following systemic treatment for mRCC include mainly patients after cytoreductive nephrectomy. Expression of proangiogenic genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms involving genes of the vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and somatic mutations of chromatin remodeling genes were associated with response to VEGF-targeted therapy. Outcomes following treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors were initially associated with mTOR/TSC1/TSC2 mutations; however, subsequent studies did not validate these findings but rather found an association between loss of PTEN expression and PBRM1 mutations and improved outcomes. Loss of PBRM1 was initially linked to response to immunotherapy; however, larger studies question this association and showed high expression of T-effector gene signature predicted improved outcome. Primary tumors with low intratumor heterogeneity but elevated somatic copy-number alterations were associated with rapid progression at multiple sites.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nGenetic alterations may help select patients for cytoreductive nephrectomy and optimize timing of treatment. Intratumor heterogeneity and genetic discordance between primary and metastatic tumors may limit clinical applicability. Future studies should evaluate approaches to overcome these limitations.",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 are major survival signals that drive prostate cancer to a lethal disease. Reciprocal activation of these oncogenic pathways from negative cross talks contributes to low/limited success of pathway-selective inhibitors in curbing prostate cancer progression. We report that the antibiotic salinomycin, a cancer stem cell blocker, is a dual-acting AR and mTORC1 inhibitor, inhibiting PTEN-deficient castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer in culture and xenograft tumors. AR expression, its transcriptional activity, and androgen biosynthesis regulating enzymes CYP17A1, HSD3β1 were reduced by sub-micro molar salinomycin. Estrogen receptor-α expression was unchanged. Loss of phosphorylated AR at serine-81, which is an index for nuclear AR activity, preceded total AR reduction. Rapamycin enhanced the AR protein level without altering phosphoAR-Ser81 and CYP17A1. Inactivation of mTORC1, evident from reduced phosphorylation of mTOR and downstream effectors, as well as AMPK activation led to robust autophagy induction. Apoptosis increased modestly, albeit significantly, by sub-micro molar salinomycin. Enhanced stimulatory TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser-1387 by AMPK, and reduced inhibitory TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser-939/Thr-1462 catalyzed by AKT augmented TSC2/TSC1 activity, which led to mTORC1 inhibition. AMPK-mediated raptor phosphorylation further reduced mTOR's kinase function and mTORC1 activity. Our novel finding on dual inhibition of AR and mTORC1 suggests that salinomycin is potentially active as monotherapy against advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is a highly complex physiological process which contains spermatogonia proliferation, spermatocyte meiosis and spermatid morphogenesis. In the past decade, actin binding proteins and signaling pathways which are critical for regulating the actin cytoskeleton in testis had been found. In this review, we summarized 5 actin-binding proteins that have been proven to play important roles in the seminiferous epithelium. Lack of them perturbs spermatids polarity and the transport of spermatids. The loss of Arp2/3 complex, Formin1, Eps8, Palladin and Plastin3 cause sperm release failure suggesting their irreplaceable role in spermatogenesis. Actin regulation relies on multiple signal pathways. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway positively regulate the mTOR pathway to promote actin reorganization in seminiferous epithelium. Conversely, TSC1/TSC2 complex, the upstream of mTOR, is activated by the LKB1/AMPK pathway to inhibit cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. The increasing researches focus on the function of actin binding proteins (ABPs), however, their collaborative regulation of actin patterns and potential regulatory signaling networks remains unclear. We reviewed ABPs that play important roles in mammalian spermatogenesis and signal pathways involved in the regulation of microfilaments. We suggest that more relevant studies should be performed in the future.",

    "abstract": "Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a potential target for cancer therapy. It functions as a growth regulating protein implicated in the TSC1-TSC2 -mTOR pathway or a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for the elongation factors EF1A and EF1Bbeta. Accumulating evidence indicates that TCTP also functions as an antiapoptotic protein, through a hitherto unknown mechanism. In keeping with this, we show here that loss of tctp expression in mice leads to increased spontaneous apoptosis during embryogenesis and causes lethality between E6.5 and E9.5. To gain further mechanistic insights into this apoptotic function, we solved and refined the crystal structure of human TCTP at 2.0 A resolution. We found a structural similarity between the H2-H3 helices of TCTP and the H5-H6 helices of Bax, which have been previously implicated in regulating the mitochondrial membrane permeability during apoptosis. By site-directed mutagenesis we establish the relevance of the H2-H3 helices in TCTP's antiapoptotic function. Finally, we show that TCTP antagonizes apoptosis by inserting into the mitochondrial membrane and inhibiting Bax dimerization. Together, these data therefore further confirm the antiapoptotic role of TCTP in vivo and provide new mechanistic insights into this key function of TCTP.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy or autophagy is a degradative pathway terminating in the lysosomal compartment after the formation of a cytoplasmic vacuole that engulfs macromolecules and organelles. The recent discovery of the molecular controls of autophagy that are common to eukaryotic cells from yeast to human suggests that the role of autophagy in cell functioning is far beyond its nonselective degradative capacity. The downregulation of autophagy observed in cancer cells is associated with tumor progression. The regulation of autophagy by signalling pathways overlaps with the control of cell growth, proliferation, cell survival and death. Two of these pathways play an important role in control of autophagy, the class I and III PI3K pathways. Several tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, TSC1 and 2, p53) involved in the class I PI3K mTOR signalling network have been shown to stimulate autophagy. In contrast, the oncoproteins involved in this network (Ras, class I PI3K and Akt) have the opposite effect. These findings, together with the discovery that Beclin 1, which forms a complex with the class III PI3K to initiate autophagy, is a tumor suppressor gene product give credibility of the idea that autophagy is a tumor suppressor mechanism. However, cancer cells sometimes mobilize autophagic capacities in response to various stimuli, suggesting that they can also exploit autophagy for their own benefit.",

    "abstract": "The TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes control the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Elevated activity of this pathway in Tsc2+/- mouse model leads to reduction of postsynaptic GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition and hyperexcitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In this study, we asked whether presynaptic GABAB receptors (GABABRs) can compensate this shift of hyperexcitability. Experiments were performed in brain slices from adolescent wild-type (WT) and Tsc2+/- mice. Miniature and spontaneous postsynaptic currents (m/sPSCs) were recorded from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mPFC using patch-clamp technique using a Cs+-based intrapipette solution. Presynaptic GABABRs were activated by baclofen (10 µM) or blocked by CGP55845 (1 µM). Independent on genotype, GABABR modulators bidirectionally change miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency by about 10%, indicating presynaptic GABABR-mediated effects on glutamatergic transmission are comparable in both genotypes. In contrast, frequencies of both mIPSCs and sIPCSs were suppressed by baclofen stronger in Tsc2+/- neurons than in WT ones, whereas CGP55845 significantly increased (m/s)IPSC frequencies only in WT cells. Effects of baclofen and CGP55845 on the amplitudes of evoked (e)IPSCs confirmed these observations. These data indicate (1) that GABAergic synapses are inhibited by ambient GABA in WT but not in Tsc2+/- slices, and (2) that baclofen shifts the E/I ratio, determined as the ratio of (m/s)EPSC frequency to (m/s)IPSC frequency, towards excitation only in Tsc2+/- cells. This excitatory presynaptic GABABR-mediated action has to be taken into account for a possible medication of mental disorders using baclofen.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is not only the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it is also effective as an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-tumor agent. However, the effect of metformin during viral hepatitis remains elusive. Using an adenovirus (Ad)-induced viral hepatitis mouse model, we found that metformin treatment significantly attenuated liver injury, with reduced serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and liver histological changes, presumably via decreased effector T cell responses. We then demonstrated that metformin reduced mTORC1 activity in T cells from infected mice, as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of ribosome protein S6 (p-S6). The inhibitory effects on the mTORC1 signaling by metformin was dependent on the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1). Mechanistically, metformin treatment modulated the phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) and mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1), resulting in increased mass in effector T cells. Moreover, metformin treatment promoted mitochondrial superoxide production, which can inhibit excessive T cell activation in viral hepatitis. Together, our results revealed a protective role and therapeutic potential of metformin against liver injury in acute viral hepatitis via modulating effector T cell activation via regulating the mTORC1 pathway and mitochondrial functions.",

    "abstract": "Immune cell development and function must be tightly regulated through cell surface receptors to ensure proper responses to pathogen and tolerance to self. In T cells, the signal from the T-cell receptor is essential for T-cell maturation, homeostasis, and activation. In mast cells, the high-affinity receptor for IgE transduces signal that promotes mast cell survival and induces mast cell activation. In dendritic cells and macrophages, the toll-like receptors recognize microbial pathogens and play critical roles for both innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens. Our research explores how signaling from these receptors is transduced and regulated to better understand these immune cells. Our recent studies have revealed diacylglycerol kinases and TSC1/2-mTOR as critical signaling molecules/regulators in T cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.",

    "issue": "26(2)",
    "pages": "189-202",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPrimary mucosal melanomas (PMMs) are rare and clinically heterogeneous, including head and neck (HNMs), vulvovaginal (VVMs), conjunctival (CjMs), anorectal (ARMs) and penile (PMs) melanomas. While the prognosis of advanced cutaneous melanoma has noticeably improved using treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecules targeting BRAF and MEK, few advances have been made for PMMs because of their poorer response to ICIs and their different genetic profile. This prompted us to conduct a systematic review of molecular studies of PMMs to clarify their pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll articles that examined gene mutations in PMMs were identified from the databases and selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Mutation rate was calculated for all PMMs and each location group by relating the number of mutations identified to the total number of samples analysed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 1,581 studies identified, 88 were selected. Overall, the frequency of KIT, BRAF and NRAS mutation was 13.5%, 12.9% and 12.1%, respectively. KIT mutation ranged from 6.4% for CjMs to 16.6% for ARMs, BRAF mutation from 8.6% for ARMs to 31.1% for CjMs, and NRAS mutation from 6.2% for ARMs to 18.5% for CjMs. Among 101 other genes analysed, 33 had mutation rates over 10%, including TTN, TSC1, POM121, NF1, MTOR and SF3B1.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn addition to BRAF, NRAS and KIT genes commonly studied, our systematic review identified significantly mutated genes that have already been associated (e.g., TSC1, mTOR, POLE or ATRX) or could be associated with (future) targeted therapies.\n\n\nPROSPERO ID\nCRD42020185552.",

    "issue": "5(1)",
    "pages": "131-9",
    "abstract": "TSC2 (Tuberous sclerosis complex 2) is an important tumour suppressor gene, mutations within which are linked to the development of tuberous sclerosis and implicated in multiple tumour types. TSC2 protein complexes with TSC1 and blocks the ability of the Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase to activate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a crucial signal transducer which regulates protein synthesis and cell growth. Here, we report the characterisation of a novel isoform of TSC2 which is under direct control of the ligand-activated androgen receptor. TSC2 isoform A (TSC2A) is derived from an internal androgen-regulated alternative promoter and encodes a 508-amino acid cytoplasmic protein corresponding to the C-terminal region of full-length TSC2, lacking the interaction domain for TSC1 and containing an incomplete interaction domain required for Rheb inactivation. Expression of TSC2A is induced in response to androgens and full-length TSC2 is co-ordinately down-regulated, indicating an androgen-driven switch in TSC2 protein isoforms. In contrast to the well-characterised suppressive effect on cell proliferation of full-length TSC2 protein, both LNCaP and HEK293 cells over-expressing TSC2 isoform A proliferate more rapidly (measured by MTT assays) and have increased levels of cells in S-phase (measured by both Edu staining and FACS analysis). Our work indicates, for the first time, a novel role for this well-known tumour suppressor gene, which encodes an activator of cell proliferation in response to androgen stimulation.",

    "pages": "3200",
    "abstract": "mTOR activation is essential and sufficient to cause polycystic kidneys in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and other genetic disorders. In disease models, a sharp increase of proliferation and cyst formation correlates with a dramatic loss of oriented cell division (OCD). We find that OCD distortion is intrinsically due to S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activation. The concomitant loss of S6K1 in Tsc1-mutant mice restores OCD but does not decrease hyperproliferation, leading to non-cystic harmonious hyper growth of kidneys. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics for S6K1 substrates revealed Afadin, a known component of cell-cell junctions required to couple intercellular adhesions and cortical cues to spindle orientation. Afadin is directly phosphorylated by S6K1 and abnormally decorates the apical surface of Tsc1-mutant cells with E-cadherin and α-catenin. Our data reveal that S6K1 hyperactivity alters centrosome positioning in mitotic cells, affecting oriented cell division and promoting kidney cysts in conditions of mTOR hyperactivity.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects multiple organs and is caused by inactive mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The main symptoms of TSC are neurocutaneous syndrome and benign hamartoma formation. Notably, malignancy is not an indication of TSC. In this article, we present the case of a 48-year-old female with cervical cancer (CC) combined with TSC, who was misdiagnosed with multiple metastases. Toe masses, pelvic nodules, and multiple osteogenic lesions were initially observed. Multi-site puncture biopsies and a toe amputation were performed; the pathology results did not indicate malignancy. Subsequently, hypomelanotic macules on the back, subependymal nodules (SENs), ungual fibromas, multiple renal cysts, and sclerotic-bone-lesions (SBLs) of the skull, and vertebrae were observed, leading to a diagnosis of TSC. Given that TSC is a benign disease and has not yet caused any organ disfunction, no special treatment was provided to this patient. After a follow-up period of almost 65 months, the patient's quality of life remained good without therapy. Oncologists should pay attention to benign diseases in the face of multiple lesions to reduce misdiagnosis and overtreatment. In addition, TSC may interact with CC through molecular mechanisms, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) form a heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by deficits in social interactions and repetitive behavior/restricted interests. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain types of ASD, and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin has been demonstrated to be an effective therapeutics for impaired social interaction in Tsc1+/-, Tsc2+/-, Pten-/- mice and valproic acid-induced ASD animal models. However, it is still unknown if dysregulation of mTOR signaling is responsible for the ASD-related deficit caused by other genes mutations. Contactin associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is the first widely replicated autism-predisposition gene. Mice deficient in Cntnap2 (Cntnap2-/- mice) show core ASD-like phenotypes, and have been demonstrated as a validated model for ASD-relevant drug discovery. In this study, we found hyperactive Akt-mTOR signaling in the hippocampus of Cntnap2-/- mice with RNA sequencing followed with biochemical analysis. Treatment with Akt inhibitor LY294002 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescued the social deficit, but had no effect on hyperactivity and repetitive behavior/restricted behavior in Cntnap2-/- mice. We further showed that the effect of LY294002 and rapamycin on social behaviors is reversible. Our results thus identified hyperactive Akt-mTOR signaling pathway as a therapeutic target for abnormal social behavior in patients with dysfunction of CNTNAP2.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactivated mTOR signaling in the developing brain has been implicated in multiple forms of pathology including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). To date, various phenotypic defects such as cortical lamination irregularity, subependymal nodule formation, dysmorphic astrocyte differentiation and dendritic malformation have been described for patients and animal models. However, downstream networks affected in the developing brain by hyperactivated mTOR signaling have yet to be characterized. Here, we present an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes generated from wild-type and Tsc1/Emx1-Cre forebrains. This led to comprehensive lists of genes and proteins whose expression levels were altered by hyperactivated mTOR signaling. Further incorporation of TSC patient data followed by functional enrichment and network analyses pointed to changes in molecular components and cellular processes associated with neuronal differentiation and morphogenesis as the key downstream events underlying developmental and morphological defects in TSC. Our results provide novel and fundamental molecular bases for understanding hyperactivated mTOR signaling-induced brain defects which can in turn facilitate identification of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for mTOR signaling-related neurological disorders.",

    "issue": "7(349)",
    "pages": "ra103",
    "abstract": "In patients with Huntington's disease (HD), the protein huntingtin (Htt) has an expanded polyglutamine (poly-Q) tract. HD results in early loss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum, which impairs motor and cognitive functions. Identifying the physiological role and molecular functions of Htt may yield insight into HD pathogenesis. We found that Htt promotes signaling by mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1] and that this signaling is potentiated by poly-Q-expanded Htt. Knocking out Htt in mouse embryonic stem cells or human embryonic kidney cells attenuated amino acid-induced mTORC1 activity, whereas overexpressing wild-type or poly-Q-expanded Htt in striatal neuronal cells increased basal mTOR activity. Striatal cells expressing endogenous poly-Q-expanded Htt showed an increase in the number and size of mTOR puncta on the perinuclear regions compared to cells expressing wild-type Htt. Pull-down experiments indicated that amino acids stimulated the interaction of Htt and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rheb (a protein that stimulates mTOR activity), and that Htt forms a ternary complex with Rheb and mTOR. Pharmacologically inhibiting PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) or knocking down Rheb abrogated mTORC1 activity induced by expression of a poly-Q-expanded amino-terminal Htt fragment. Moreover, striatum-specific deletion of TSC1, encoding tuberous sclerosis 1, a negative regulator of mTORC1, accelerated the onset of motor coordination abnormalities and caused premature death in an HD mouse model. Together, our findings demonstrate that mutant Htt contributes to the pathogenesis of HD by enhancing mTORC1 activity.",

    "issue": "44(10)",
    "pages": "2266-74",
    "abstract": "Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a distinct type of soft tissue sarcoma holding a specific ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcript. Curative therapy is based on surgical removal, whereas lately, antiangiogenic targeted therapy regimens have proven effective. In ASPS, analysis of small series additionally display mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway activity, thus making mTOR a possible additive target in ASPS, because it is in other tumor entities. Therefore, we systematically evaluated mTOR pathway activity in a large series of ASPS in comparison with soft tissue sarcomas of other differentiation (non-ASPS). Upstream and downstream factors of mTOR signaling and ancillary targets were analyzed in 103 cases (22 ASPS, 81 non-ASPS) by immunohistochemistry mostly using phospho-specific antibodies. TFE3 (transcription factor for immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer 3) translocation status was determined by FISH and RT-PCR. All ASPS were positive in TFE3 break-apart FISH and exhibited specific fusion products when RNA was available (type 1: 9x, type 2: 11x), whereas TFE3-immunoreactive non-ASPS did not. In ASPS, TFE3-, cMET-, pAKT T308- (all P < .0001), pp70S6K- (P = .002), and p4EBP1 (P = .087) expression levels were elevated, whereas pAKT S473 was decreased (P < .0001). In addition, ASPS exhibited higher TFE3-, cMET-, pAKT T308-, and pp70S6K- expression levels compared with TFE3-immunopositive non-ASPS sarcomas (all P < .001). We demonstrate elevated mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in ASPS independent of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) activation. mTORC1 activity seems to be related to the existence of ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcripts because TFE3-immunoreactive non-ASPS without ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcripts exhibit significantly lower mTORC1 activation status. Small molecule-based targeting of mTOR might therefore represent a potential mechanism in ASPS alone or in combination with contemporary upstream approaches.",

    "pages": "135-144",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and is characterized by widespread tumour growth, intractable epilepsy, cognitive deficits and autistic behaviour. CBD has been reported to decrease seizures and inhibit tumour cell progression, therefore we sought to determine the influence of CBD on TSC pathology in zebrafish carrying a nonsense mutation in the tsc2 gene. CBD treatment from 6 to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) induced significant anxiolytic actions without causing sedation. Furthermore, CBD treatment from 3 dpf had no impact on tsc2-/- larvae motility nor their survival. CBD treatment did, however, reduce the number of phosphorylated rpS6 positive cells, and their cross-sectional cell size. This suggests a CBD mediated suppression of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in the tsc2-/- larval brain. Taken together, these data suggest that CBD selectively modulates levels of phosphorylated rpS6 in the brain and additionally provides an anxiolytic effect. This is pertinent given the alterations in mTOR signalling in experimental models of TSC. Additional work is necessary to identify upstream signal modulation and to further justify the use of CBD as a possible therapeutic strategy to manage TSC.",

    "issue": "43(1)",
    "pages": "121-131",
    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of renal cell neoplasms with solid or nested architecture and eosinophilic cytoplasm has become increasingly complex. Despite recent advances in classifying a number of entities exhibiting this morphology, some tumors remain in the unclassified category. Here we describe a morphologically distinct group of sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with predominantly nested architecture, eosinophilic, and remarkably vacuolated cytoplasm retrospectively identified from a cohort of previously unclassified tumors. We examined the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of these tumors and investigated their mutational and copy number alterations using a targeted next-generation sequencing platform. The study included 7 patients with a mean age of 54 years (range: 40 to 68 y) and a male to female ratio of 3:4. All patients presented with a solitary renal mass and had no prior medical or family history raising concern for syndromic conditions. Tumors were well-circumscribed, unencapsulated, and comprised of nests of eosinophilic cells in a hypocellular and often edematous stroma. Tumor cells had round nuclei with prominent nucleoli and granular cytoplasm with striking vacuolization. Thick-walled vessels and calcifications were also frequently present, whereas increased mitotic activity, necrosis, foamy histiocytes or lymphocytic infiltrates were not identified. All cases were positive for PAX8, had retained expression of SDHB and FH, and exhibited a CK7-/CK20- phenotype. While cathepsin-K was positive in 5 cases, none exhibited immunoreactivity to HMB45 or Melan A, or TFE3 immunostaining. Next-generation sequencing identified somatic inactivating mutations of TSC2 (3/5 tumors tested) or activating mutations of MTOR (2/5) as the primary molecular alterations, consistent with hyperactive mTOR complex 1 signaling which was further demonstrated by phospho-S6 and phospho-4E-BP1 immunostaining. Copy number analysis revealed a loss of chromosome 1 in both cases with MTOR mutation. These tumors represent a novel subset of sporadic RCC characterized by alterations in TSC1-TSC2 complex or the mTOR complex 1 pathway. Recognition of their characteristic morphologic and immunophenotypic features will allow them to be readily identified and separated from the unclassified RCC category.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Tsc1 or Tsc2 genes cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Tsc1 and Tsc2 proteins form a complex that inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling through Rheb-GTPase. We found that Tsc2(+/-) neurons showed impaired spine synapse formation, which was resistant to an mTORC1 inhibitor. Knockdown of mTOR also failed to restore these abnormalities, suggesting mTORC may not participate in impaired spinogenesis in Tsc2(+/-) neurons. To address whether Rheb activation impairs spine synapse formation, we expressed active and inactive forms of Rheb in WT and Tsc2(+/-) neurons, respectively. Expression of active Rheb abolished dendritic spine formation in WT neurons, whereas inactive Rheb restored spine synapse formation in Tsc2(+/-) neurons. Moreover, inactivation of Rheb with farnesyl transferase inhibitors recovered spine synapse morphogenesis in Tsc2(+/-) neurons. In conclusion, dendritic spine abnormalities in TSC neurons may be caused through activation of Rheb, but not through of mTORC1.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominantly inherited disease that is characterized by the growth of multiple benign tumors that are often difficult to treat. TSC is caused by mutations that inactivate the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which normally function to inhibit activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. In this issue of the JCI, two studies reported by Karbowniczek et al. and Ma et al. link TSC inactivation with activated Notch signaling (see the related articles beginning on pages 93 and 103, respectively). Using a variety of approaches, both studies show that inactivation of TSC leads to Notch1 activation. Furthermore, studies in tumor cells suggest that inhibiting Notch slows growth of the tumor cells. Although much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which TSC loss leads to Notch activation, the newly identified link of TSC to Notch provides the rationale for testing Notch inhibitors in TSC-associated tumors.",

    "issue": "33(1)",
    "pages": "25-32",
    "abstract": "T helper 17 (Th17) is regarded as key immune cell in the pathogenesis of noneosinophilic asthma (NEA) due to the recruitment of neutrophils into the airways. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important signaling molecule that plays a critical role in immune regulation. This study focused on mTOR signaling pathway in the regulation of Th17-mediated neutrophilic airway inflammation.  Ovalbumin (OVA) T cell receptor transgenic DO11.10 mice (DO11.10 mice) were used to establish NEA model, and few mice received specific mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) before intranasal administration of OVA. The severity of airway inflammation was determined by differential cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and histopathologic lung analysis. The levels of various cytokines in BAL fluids and lung tissues were measured. To determine the role of mTORC1 signaling in Th17 differentiation, naive T cells from wild-type (WT) and TSC1 knockout (KO) mice were cultured in Th17 skewing condition with or without RAPA in vitro and the production of IL-17A was compared.  Treatment with RAPA markedly attenuated OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation in DO11.10 mice. Also the production of IL-17A was inhibited without affecting the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-4 in lungs. Furthermore, RAPA suppressed differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro, whereas enhanced activity of mTORC1 promoted Th17 cell differentiation and increased the expression of Th17-related transcription factors RORγt and RORα.  These results suggested that mTOR promoted Th17 cell polarization and enhanced OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation in experimental NEA.",

    "issue": "2(5)",
    "pages": "e159",
    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are now emerging as a novel class of autophagy activators. Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (f-SWCNTs) are valuable nanomaterials in many industries. This article is designed to assess the autophagic response for f-SWCNTs exposure in vitro and in vivo. A few types of f-SWCNTs were screened in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells for the autophagic response and related pathways in vitro. Formation of autophagosomes and LC3-II upregulation were confirmed on the basis of electron microscopy and LC3 western blotting for COOH-CNT, but not for PABS-CNT and PEG-CNT. MTT assay showed marked increase in cell viability, when COOH-CNT was added to cells in the presence of autophagy inhibitor 3MA, ATG6 or TSC2 siRNA. Consistent with the involvement of the Akt-TSC1/2-mTOR pathway, the phosphorylation levels of mTOR, mTOR's substrate S6 and Akt were shown significantly decreased in A549 cells on treatment with COOH-CNT using western blotting. What's more, autophagy inhibitor 3MA significantly reduced the lung edema in vivo. In a word, COOH-CNT induced autophagic cell death in A549 cells through the AKT-TSC2-mTOR pathway and caused acute lung injury in vivo. Inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced COOH-CNT-induced autophagic cell death and ameliorated acute lung injury in mice, suggesting a potential remedy to address the growing concerns on the safety of nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome with manifestations that can include seizures, mental retardation, autism, and tumors in the brain, retina, kidney, heart, and skin. The products of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, heterodimerize and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We found that tuberin expression increases p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and B-Raf kinase activity. Short interfering RNA down-regulation of tuberin decreased the p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and B-Raf activity. Expression of Rheb, the target of the GTPase-activating domain of tuberin, inhibited wild-type B-Raf kinase but not activated forms of B-Raf. The interaction of endogenous Rheb with B-Raf was enhanced by serum and by Ras overexpression. A farnesylation-defective mutant of Rheb co-immunoprecipitated with and inhibited B-Raf but did not activate ribosomal protein S6 kinase, indicating that farnesylation is not required for B-Raf inhibition by Rheb and that B-Raf inhibition and S6 kinase activation are separable activities of Rheb. Consistent with this, inhibition of B-Raf and p42/44 MAPK by Rheb was resistant to rapamycin in contrast to Rheb activation of S6 kinase, which is rapamycin-sensitive. Taken together these data demonstrate that inhibition of B-Raf kinase via Rheb is an mTOR-independent function of tuberin.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and characterized by developmental brain abnormalities. In the present study we discuss the neuropathological findings of a 32-year-old patient with a germ-line mutation in the TSC2 gene. Post mortem MRI combined with histology and immunocytochemical analysis was applied to demonstrate widespread anatomical abnormalities of gray and white matter structure. TSC brain lesions were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 16p13. The neuropathological supratentorial abnormalities were represented by multiple subependymal nodules (SENs) and cortical tubers. In addition to cerebral cortical lesions, cerebellar lesions and hippocampal sclerosis were also observed. LOH was not found in the cortical tubers and SENs of this patient. Immunocytochemical analysis of the TSC brain lesions confirmed the cell-specific activation of the mTOR pathway in cortical tubers, SENs and cerebellum, as well as differential cellular localization of hamartin and tuberin, the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products. Examination of the pathological brain regions revealed activated microglial cells and disruption of blood-brain barrier permeability. Predominant intralesional cell-specific distribution was also detected for the multidrug transporter protein P-gp, possibly explaining the mechanisms underlying the pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs. Autopsy findings confirm the complexity of the brain abnormalities encountered in TSC patients and proved useful in clarifying certain aspects of the pathogenesis, epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance of TSC lesions.",

    "issue": "186(7)",
    "pages": "1825-1836",
    "abstract": "Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a tumor closely related to lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Both entities are characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle actin and melanocytic glycoprotein 100 (recognized by antibody HMB-45)-positive spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells. AML and LAM are etiologically linked to mutations in the tsc2 and tsc1 genes in the case of LAM. These genes encode the proteins tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-1 and TSC2, which are directly involved in suppressing the mechanistic target of rapamycin cell growth signaling pathway. Although significant progress has been made in characterizing and pharmacologically slowing the progression of AML and LAM with rapamycin, our understanding of their pathogenesis lacks an identified cell of origin. We used an AML-derived cell line to determine whether TSC2 restitution brings about the cell type from which AML arises. We found that AML cells express lymphatic endothelial cell markers consistent with lymphatic endothelial cell precursors in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, on TSC2 correction, AML cells mature into adult lymphatic endothelial cells and have functional attributes characteristic of this cell lineage, suggesting a lymphatic endothelial cell of origin for AML. These effects are dependent on TSC2-mediated mechanistic target of rapamycin inactivation. Finally, we demonstrate the in vitro effectiveness of norcantharidin, a lymphangiogenesis inhibitor, as a potential co-adjuvant therapy in the treatment of AML.",

    "pages": "234-46",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively, cause the tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis with similar phenotypes. Until now, over 50 proteins have been demonstrated to interact with hamartin and/or tuberin. Besides tuberin, the proteins DOCK7, ezrin/radixin/moesin, FIP200, IKKbeta, Melted, Merlin, NADE(p75NTR), NF-L, Plk1 and TBC7 have been found to interact with hamartin. Whereas Plk1 and TBC7 have been demonstrated not to bind to tuberin, for all the other hamartin-interacting proteins the question, whether they can also bind to tuberin, has not been studied. Tuberin interacts with 14-3-3 beta,epsilon,gamma,eta,sigma,tau,zeta, Akt, AMPK, CaM, CRB3/PATJ, cyclin A, cyclins D1, D2, D3, Dsh, ERalpha, Erk, FoxO1, HERC1, HPV16 E6, HSCP-70, HSP70-1, MK2, NEK1, p27KIP1, Pam, PC1, PP2Ac, Rabaptin-5, Rheb, RxRalpha/VDR and SMAD2/3. 14-3-3 beta,epsilon,gamma,eta,sigma,tau,zeta, Akt, Dsh, FoxO1, HERC1, p27KIP1 and PP2Ac are known not to bind to hamartin. For the other tuberin-interacting proteins this question remains elusive. The proteins axin, Cdk1, cyclin B1, GADD34, GSK3, mTOR and RSK1 have been found to co-immunoprecipitate with both, hamartin and tuberin. The kinases Cdk1 and IKKbeta phosphorylate hamartin, Erk, Akt, MK2, AMPK and RSK1 phosphorylate tuberin, and GSK3 phosphorylates both, hamartin and tuberin. This detailed summary of protein interactions allows new insights into their relevance for the wide variety of different functions of hamartin and tuberin.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc), a phacomatosis, is a rare genetic disease (autosomal dominant; incidence: 1 in 6,800-17,300) associated with mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, 70% of which are sporadic. The disease causes benign tumours in the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, skin, and eyes; thyroid lesions are extremely rare. A 13-year-old euthyroid boy with a hereditary form of tsc (del 4730G in TSC2, also seen in 2 sisters and the father) was admitted to hospital with a thyroid nodule. Physical examination revealed a nodular left lobe with increased consistency. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous left lobe, predominantly hypoechoic with multiple microcalcifications and the presence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes on the left side. A macrocalcification was observed on the right lobe. Fine-needle biopsy results showed a few groups of cells with discrete atypical characteristics, including abundant cytoplasm, nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli, intra-nuclear inclusions, and nuclear grooves. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy. Histopathology examination confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma. The coincidence of endocrine neoplasia including thyroid cancer and tsc is rare, and tsc with papillary thyroid carcinoma has never been described in a child. Studies of mutations in the tumour suppressor genes TSC1, TSC2, and STK11, activating the mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, might support their role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer.",

    "issue": "51(4)",
    "pages": "284-92",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease characterized by multiorgan benign tumors as well as neurological manifestations. Epilepsy and autism are two of the more prevalent neurological complications and are usually severe. TSC is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (encodes hamartin) or the TSC2 (encodes tuberin) genes with TSC2 mutations being associated with worse outcomes. Tuberin contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain that indirectly inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 dysregulation is currently thought to cause much of the pathogenesis in TSC but mTORC1-independent mechanisms may also contribute. We generated a novel conditional allele of Tsc2 by flanking exons 36 and 37 with loxP sites. Mice homozygous for this knock-in Tsc2 allele are viable and fertile with normal appearing growth and development. Exposure to Cre recombinase then creates an in-frame deletion involving critical residues of the GAP domain. Homozygous conditional mutant mice generated using Emx1(Cre) have increased cortical mTORC1 signaling, severe developmental brain anomalies, seizures, and die within 3 weeks. We found that the normal levels of the mutant Tsc2 mRNA, though GAP-deficient tuberin protein, appear unstable and rapidly degraded. This novel animal model will allow further study of tuberin function including the requirement of the GAP domain for protein stability.",

    "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex inactivation disrupts melanogenesis via mTORC1 activation.",
    "issue": "127(1)",
    "pages": "349-364",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor-suppressor gene syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, and the TSC protein complex is an essential regulator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Patients with TSC develop hypomelanotic macules (white spots), but the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation are not fully characterized. Using human primary melanocytes and a highly pigmented melanoma cell line, we demonstrate that reduced expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 causes reduced pigmentation through mTORC1 activation, which results in hyperactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), followed by phosphorylation of and loss of β-catenin from the nucleus, thereby reducing expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and subsequent reductions in tyrosinase and other genes required for melanogenesis. Genetic suppression or pharmacological inhibition of this signaling cascade at multiple levels restored pigmentation. Importantly, primary melanocytes isolated from hypomelanotic macules from 6 patients with TSC all exhibited reduced TSC2 protein expression, and 1 culture showed biallelic mutation in TSC2, one of which was germline and the second acquired in the melanocytes of the hypomelanotic macule. These findings indicate that the TSC/mTORC1/AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin/MITF axis plays a central role in regulating melanogenesis. Interventions that enhance or diminish mTORC1 activity or other nodes in this pathway in melanocytes could potentially modulate pigment production.",

    "abstract": "Human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), commonly display constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) AKT signaling. However, the exact role of AKT activation in leukemia and its effects on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are poorly understood. Several members of the PI3K pathway, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), the forkhead box, subgroup O (FOXO) transcription factors, and TSC1, have demonstrated functions in normal and leukemic stem cells but are rarely mutated in leukemia. We developed an activated allele of AKT1 that models increased signaling in normal and leukemic stem cells. In our murine bone marrow transplantation model using a myristoylated AKT1 (myr-AKT), recipients develop myeloproliferative disease, T-cell lymphoma, or AML. Analysis of the HSCs in myr-AKT mice reveals transient expansion and increased cycling, associated with impaired engraftment. myr-AKT-expressing bone marrow cells are unable to form cobblestones in long-term cocultures. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) rescues cobblestone formation in myr-AKT-expressing bone marrow cells and increases the survival of myr-AKT mice. This study demonstrates that enhanced AKT activation is an important mechanism of transformation in AML and that HSCs are highly sensitive to excess AKT/mTOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a hamartoma syndrome in which renal and lung tumors cause the greatest morbidity. Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 in TSC hamartomas leads to activation of mTORC1 and suppression of AKT. Recent studies indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 with RAD001 (everolimus) leads to rebound activation of AKT, which could protect tumors from drug-induced cell death. Here we examine the potential benefit of inhibition of both mTOR and AKT signaling in a mouse model of TSC, using a dual pan class I PI3K/mTOR catalytic small molecule inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing ENU to enhance Tsc2+- kidney tumor development, both RAD001 (10 mg/kg PO 5 d/week) and NVP-BEZ235 (45 mg/kg PO QD) had equivalent effects in suppressing tumor development during a 4 week treatment period, with a 99% reduction in tumor cell mass. Marked reduction in activation of mTORC1, induction of cell cycle arrest, and absence of apoptotic cell death was seen in mice treated with either drug. However, when either was discontinued, there was prompt recovery of tumor growth, with extensive proliferation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBoth mTORC1 blockade alone and combined PI3K-mTOR blockade lead to suppression of tumor development but not tumor elimination in this TSC model.",

    "pages": "529-36",
    "abstract": "In human, mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex protein 1 or 2 (TSC1/2 or hamartin/tuberin) cause tuberous sclerosis characterized by the occurrence of multiple hamartomas. On the other hand, mutations in the Crumbs homolog-1 (CRB1) gene cause retinal degeneration diseases including Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa type 12. Here we report, using a two-hybrid assay, a direct molecular interaction between TSC2 C-terminal part and PDZ 2 and 3 of PATJ, a scaffold member of the Crumbs 3 (CRB 3) complex in human intestinal epithelial cells, Caco2. TSC2 interacts not only with PATJ, but also with the whole CRB 3 complex by GST-pull down assays. In addition, TSC2 co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes partially with PATJ at the level of the tight junctions. Furthermore, depletion of PATJ from Caco2 cells induces an increase in mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, which is totally inhibited by rapamycin. In contrast, in the same cells, inhibition of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) by wortmannin does not abolish rpS6 phosphorylation. These functional data indicate that the Crumbs complex is a potential regulator of the mTORC1 pathway, cell metabolism and survival through a direct interaction with TSC1/2.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous autosomal-dominant genetic syndrome marked by development of hamartomatous lesions arising from dysfunction of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although TSC remains a heterogeneous clinical entity, the recent inclusion of genetic diagnostic criteria reflects advancement in our understanding of its underlying etiopathogenesis. Abnormal cellular growth, differentiation, and migration result in multisystem sequelae, with neurologic manifestations of TSC representing the primary cause of morbidity and mortality for the majority of individuals. Modern imaging techniques aid in the diagnosis of TSC and guide treatment strategies by revealing central nervous system findings. Cortical tubers are the namesake lesion of the disorder and occur in up to 90% of cases, often exerting significant epileptogenic potential. Subependymal nodules are found in 80% of patients as calcified tumors lining the ependyma of the lateral ventricles. In some cases, these nodules are thought to progress to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and may present with obstructive hydrocephalus. Retinal astrocytic hamartomas are also common, present in 50% of patients. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for large or symptomatic lesions, though clinical trials have highlighted a potential role for mTOR pathway antagonism. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for achieving optimal patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Rapamycins are immunosuppressant and anti-cancer drugs that inhibit the kinase mTOR. Clinically, they often cause bone pain, bone necrosis, and high bone turnover, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that mTORC1 activity is high in osteoclast precursors but downregulated upon RANKL treatment. Loss-of-function genetic models reveal that while early Raptor deletion in hematopoietic stem cells blunts osteoclastogenesis due to compromised proliferation/survival, late Raptor deletion in osteoclast precursors instead augments osteoclastogenesis. Gain-of-function genetic models by TSC1 deletion in HSCs or osteoclast precursors cause constitutive mTORC1 activation, impairing osteoclastogenesis. Pharmacologically, rapamycin treatment at low but clinically relevant doses exacerbates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, leading to bone loss. Mechanistically, RANKL inactivates mTORC1 via calcineurin-mediated mTORC1 dephosphorylation, consequently activating NFATc1 by reducing mTORC1-mediated NFATc1 phosphorylation. These findings uncover biphasic roles of mTORC1 in osteoclastogenesis, dosage-dependent effects of rapamycin on bone, and a previously unrecognized calcineurin-mTORC1-NFATc1 phosphorylation-regulatory signaling cascade.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLow nephron number at birth is associated with a high risk of CKD in adulthood because nephrogenesis is completed in utero. Poor intrauterine environment impairs nephron endowment via an undefined molecular mechanism. A calorie-restricted diet (CRD) mouse model examined the effect of malnutrition during pregnancy on nephron progenitor cells (NPCs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nDaily caloric intake was reduced by 30% during pregnancy. mRNA expression, the cell cycle, and metabolic activity were evaluated in sorted Six2 NPCs. The results were validated using transgenic mice, oral nutrient supplementation, and organ cultures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMaternal CRD is associated with low nephron number in offspring, compromising kidney function at an older age. RNA-seq identified cell cycle regulators and the mTORC1 pathway, among other pathways, that maternal malnutrition in NPCs modifies. Metabolomics analysis of NPCs singled out the methionine pathway as crucial for NPC proliferation and maintenance. Methionine deprivation reduced NPC proliferation and lowered NPC number per tip in embryonic kidney cultures, with rescue from methionine metabolite supplementation. Importantly, in vivo, the negative effect of caloric restriction on nephrogenesis was prevented by adding methionine to the otherwise restricted diet during pregnancy or by removing one Tsc1 allele in NPCs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings show that mTORC1 signaling and methionine metabolism are central to the cellular and metabolic effects of malnutrition during pregnancy on NPCs, contributing to nephrogenesis and later, to kidney health in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies report a cross-talk between the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes. mTOR signalling is upregulated in PKD and rapamycin slows cyst expansion, whereas renal inactivation of the Tsc genes causes cysts. Here we identify a new interplay between the PKD and TSC genes, with important implications for the pathophysiology of both diseases. Kidney-specific inactivation of either Pkd1 or Tsc1 using an identical Cre (KspCre) results in aggressive or very mild PKD, respectively. Unexpectedly, we find that mTORC1 negatively regulates the biogenesis of polycystin-1 (PC-1) and trafficking of the PC-1/2 complex to cilia. Genetic interaction studies reveal an important role for PC-1 downregulation by mTORC1 in the cystogenesis of Tsc1 mutants. Our data potentially explain the severe renal manifestations of the TSC/PKD contiguous gene syndrome and open new perspectives for the use of mTOR inhibitors in autosomal dominant PKD caused by hypomorphic or missense PKD1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "cAMP and mTOR signalling pathways control a number of critical cellular processes including metabolism, protein synthesis, proliferation and cell survival and therefore understanding the signalling events which integrate these two signalling pathways is of particular interest. In this study, we show that the pharmacological elevation of [cAMP](i) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells inhibits mTORC1 activation via a PKA-dependent mechanism. Although the inhibitory effect of cAMP on mTOR could be mediated by impinging on signalling cascades (i.e. PKB, MAPK and AMPK) that inhibit TSC1/2, an upstream negative regulator of mTORC1, we show that cAMP inhibits mTORC1 in TSC2 knockout (TSC2(-/-)) MEFs. We also show that cAMP inhibits insulin and amino acid-stimulated mTORC1 activation independently of Rheb, Rag GTPases, TSC2, PKB, MAPK and AMPK, indicating that cAMP may act independently of known regulatory inputs into mTOR. Moreover, we show that the prolonged elevation in [cAMP](i) can also inhibit mTORC2. We provide evidence that this cAMP-dependent inhibition of mTORC1/2 is caused by the dissociation of mTORC1 and 2 and a reduction in mTOR catalytic activity, as determined by its auto-phosphorylation on Ser2481. Taken together, these results provide an important insight into how cAMP signals to mTOR and down-regulates its activity, which may lead to the identification of novel drug targets to inhibit mTOR that could be used for the treatment and prevention of human diseases such as cancer.",

    "issue": "23(4)",
    "pages": "265-80",
    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease in women. Patients with LAM develop metastatic smooth-muscle cell adenomas within the lungs, resulting in reduced pulmonary function. LAM cells contain mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes (TSC1 or TSC2), leading to up-regulation of mTORC1 activity and elevated proliferation. The origin of LAM cells remains unknown; however, inactivation of Tsc2 gene in the mouse uterus resulted in myometrial tumors exhibiting LAM features, and approximately 50% of animals developed metastatic myometrial lung tumors. This suggests that LAM tumors might originate from the uterine myometrium, possibly explaining the overwhelming prevalence of LAM in female. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Tsc2-null myometrial tumors exhibit nearly all the features of LAM, including mTORC1/S6K activation, as well as expression of melanocytic markers and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Estrogen ablation reduces S6K signaling and results in Tsc2-null myometrial tumor regression. Thus, even without TSC2, estradiol is required to maintain tumors and mTORC1/S6K signaling. Additionally, we find that MMP-2 and -9, as well as neutrophil elastase (NE), are overexpressed in Tsc2-null myometrial tumors in an estrogen-dependent fashion. In vivo fluorescent imaging using MMP- or NE-sensitive optical biomarkers confirms that protease activity is specific to myometrial tumors. Similar to LAM cells, uterine Tsc2-null myometrial cells also overexpress melanocytic markers in an estrogen-dependent fashion. Finally, we identify glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) as a melanocytic marker up-regulated in Tsc2-null mouse uteri and human LAM samples. Our data highlight the potential importance of estradiol in LAM cells, suggesting that anti-estrogen therapy may be a treatment modality. Furthermore, proteases and GPNMB might be useful LAM biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from autosomal dominant mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, leading to a hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and gray and white matter defects in the brain. To study the involvement of neuron-glia interactions in TSC phenotypes, we generated TSC patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neuronal and oligodendrocyte (OL) cultures. TSC neuron mono-cultures showed increased network activity, as measured by calcium transients and action potential firing, and increased dendritic branching. However, in co-cultures with OLs, neuronal defects became more apparent, showing cellular hypertrophy and increased axonal density. In addition, TSC neuron-OL co-cultures showed increased OL cell proliferation and decreased OL maturation. Pharmacological intervention with the mTOR regulator rapamycin suppressed these defects. Our patient iPSC-based model, therefore, shows a complex cellular TSC phenotype arising from the interaction of neuronal and glial cells and provides a platform for TSC disease modeling and drug development.",

    "pages": "539-50",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nGenetic loss of Tsc1/Tsc2 function in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) results in altered mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and abnormal brain development. Although earlier studies have focused on characterization of cortical tubers, in this study we sought to examine the unique cellular and molecular features of the perituberal cortex in order to better understand its contribution to epileptogenesis, cognitive dysfunction, and autism.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStandard histologic and immunohistochemical labeling was used to assess structural abnormalities and cell-specific pattern of mTORC1 activation in surgically resected cortical tubers and perituberal cortex. Western blotting was performed to quantify the expression of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 biomarkers phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244), and phospho-Akt (Ser473), in addition to evaluating the differential expression levels of several neuronal and glial-specific proteins in tubers and peritubers, as compared to non-TSC epilepsy specimens.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTubers demonstrated mild to severe disruption of cortical lamination, the presence of pS6-positive dysplastic neurons and giant cells, an overall increase in mTORC1 and a decrease in mTORC2 activity, increased axonal connectivity and growth, and hypomyelination. Perituberal cortex presented similar histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features; however, they were overall milder. Axonal growth was specific for TSC and was negatively correlated with deficient myelination.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nOur results show an extension of cellular dysplasia and dysregulated mTOR signaling in the perituberal tissue, and demonstrate for the first time aberrant connectivity in human TSC brain. This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of neurologic dysfunction associated with TSC and supports the intrinsic epileptogenicity of normal-appearing perituberal cortex.

    "title": "Noncanonical Inhibition of mTORC1 by Coxiella burnetii Promotes Replication within a Phagolysosome-Like Vacuole.",
    "issue": "10(1)",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "The Q fever agent Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative bacterium that invades macrophages and replicates inside a specialized lysosomal vacuole. The pathogen employs a type 4B secretion system (T4BSS) to deliver effector proteins into the host cell that modify the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV) into a replication-permissive niche. Mature CCVs are massive degradative organelles that acquire lysosomal proteins. Inhibition of mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase by nutrient deprivation promotes autophagy and lysosome fusion, as well as activation of the transcription factors TFE3 and TFEB (TFE3/B), which upregulates expression of lysosomal genes. Here, we report that C. burnetii inhibits mTORC1 as evidenced by impaired localization of mTORC1 to endolysosomal membranes and decreased phosphorylation of elF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1 in infected cells. Infected cells exhibit increased amounts of autophagy-related proteins protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 as well as of activated TFE3. However, C. burnetii did not accelerate autophagy or block autophagic flux triggered by cell starvation. Activation of autophagy or transcription by TFE3/B increased CCV expansion without enhancing bacterial replication. By contrast, knockdown of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2, which hyperactivates mTORC1, impaired CCV expansion and bacterial replication. Together, these data demonstrate that specific inhibition of mTORC1 by C. burnetii, but not amplified cell catabolism via autophagy, is required for optimal pathogen replication. These data reveal a complex interplay between lysosomal function and host cell metabolism that regulates C. burnetii intracellular growth.IMPORTANCECoxiella burnetii is an intracellular pathogenic bacterium that replicates within a lysosomal vacuole. Biogenesis of the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV) requires effector proteins delivered into the host cell cytosol by the type 4B secretion system (T4BSS). Modifications to lysosomal physiology required for pathogen replication within the CCV are poorly understood. Mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master kinase that regulates lysosome structure and function. Nutrient deprivation inhibits mTORC1, which promotes cell catabolism in the form of accelerated autophagy and increased lysosome biosynthesis. Here, we report that C. burnetii growth is enhanced by T4BSS-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 that does not activate autophagy. Canonical inhibition of mTORC1 by starvation or inhibitor treatment that induces autophagic flux does not benefit C. burnetii growth. Furthermore, hyperactivation of mTORC1 impairs bacterial replication. These findings indicate that C. burnetii inhibition of mTORC1 without accelerated autophagy promotes bacterial growth.",

    "abstract": "Feedback inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has emerged as an important signaling event in tumor syndromes, cancer, and insulin resistance. Cells lacking the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene products are a model for this feedback regulation. We find that, despite Akt attenuation, the Akt substrate GSK3 is constitutively phosphorylated in cells and tumors lacking TSC1 or TSC2. In these settings, GSK3 phosphorylation is sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin or amino acid withdrawal, and GSK3 becomes a direct target of S6K1. This aberrant phosphorylation leads to decreased GSK3 activity and phosphorylation of downstream substrates and contributes to the growth-factor-independent proliferation of TSC-deficient cells. We find that GSK3 can also be regulated downstream of mTORC1 in a HepG2 model of cellular insulin resistance. Therefore, we define conditions in which S6K1, rather than Akt, is the predominant GSK3 regulatory kinase.",

    "issue": "11(5)",
    "pages": "467-73",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a hamartoma syndrome in which brain, renal, and lung tumors develop and cause both morbidity and death. Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 in TSC hamartomas leads to activation of mTORC1. Rapamycin and related drugs have been shown to have clinical benefit for these tumors in patients with TSC and those with sporadic forms of TSC-related neoplasms. However, lifelong therapy seems to be required, as tumors are not eliminated by this treatment. We examined the potential benefit of MLN0128, a novel potent mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor, as a therapeutic strategy for renal cystadenomas that develop in A/J Tsc2(+/-) mice. Rapamycin given by intraperitoneal injection at 3 mg/kg 3 times per week, and MLN0128 given by gavage at 0.75 mg/kg 5 times per week had equivalent effects in suppressing tumor development during a 4-week treatment period, with an approximate 99% reduction in microscopic tumor cell volume. Marked reduction in activation of mTOR complex (mTORC)1 and blockade of cell growth was seen with both drugs, whereas only MLN0128 treatment had effects in blocking mTORC2 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. However, when either drug was discontinued and mice were observed for two additional months, there was dramatic recovery of tumor growth, with extensive proliferation. Hence, longlasting tumor growth control is not achieved with transient treatment with either drug, and MLN0128 and rapamycin have equivalent therapeutic benefit in this mouse model. Differences in side-effect profiles might make MLN0128 more attractive for treatment of patients with TSC-related tumors, but will require additional study in humans.",

    "title": "MITF-MIR211 axis is a novel autophagy amplifier system during cellular stress.",
    "issue": "15(3)",
    "pages": "375-390",
    "abstract": "Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved recycling and stress response mechanism. Active at basal levels in eukaryotes, autophagy is upregulated under stress providing cells with building blocks such as amino acids. A lysosome-integrated sensor system composed of RRAG GTPases and MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) regulates lysosome biogenesis and autophagy in response to amino acid availability. Stress-mediated inhibition of MTORC1 results in the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the TFE/MITF family of transcriptional factors, and triggers an autophagy- and lysosomal-related gene transcription program. The role of family members TFEB and TFE3 have been studied in detail, but the importance of MITF proteins in autophagy regulation is not clear so far. Here we introduce for the first time a specific role for MITF in autophagy control that involves upregulation of MIR211. We show that, under stress conditions including starvation and MTOR inhibition, a MITF-MIR211 axis constitutes a novel feed-forward loop that controls autophagic activity in cells. Direct targeting of the MTORC2 component RICTOR by MIR211 led to the inhibition of the MTORC1 pathway, further stimulating MITF translocation to the nucleus and completing an autophagy amplification loop. In line with a ubiquitous function, MITF and MIR211 were co-expressed in all tested cell lines and human tissues, and the effects on autophagy were observed in a cell-type independent manner. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that MITF has rate-limiting and specific functions in autophagy regulation. Collectively, the MITF-MIR211 axis constitutes a novel and universal autophagy amplification system that sustains autophagic activity under stress conditions.

    "pages": "5849-54",
    "abstract": "Mammalian brain connectivity requires the coordinated production and migration of billions of neurons and the formation of axons and dendrites. The LKB1/Par4 kinase is required for axon formation during cortical development in vivo partially through its ability to activate SAD-A/B kinases. LKB1 is a master kinase phosphorylating and activating at least 11 other serine/threonine kinases including the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which defines this branch of the kinome. A recent study using a gene-trap allele of the β1 regulatory subunit of AMPK suggested that AMPK catalytic activity is required for proper brain development including neurogenesis and neuronal survival. We used a genetic loss-of-function approach producing AMPKα1/α2-null cortical neurons to demonstrate that AMPK catalytic activity is not required for cortical neurogenesis, neuronal migration, polarization, or survival. However, we found that application of metformin or AICAR, potent AMPK activators, inhibit axogenesis and axon growth in an AMPK-dependent manner. We show that inhibition of axon growth mediated by AMPK overactivation requires TSC1/2-mediated inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate that AMPK catalytic activity is not required for early neural development in vivo but its overactivation during metabolic stress impairs neuronal polarization in a mTOR-dependent manner.",

    "title": "Interplay between pVHL and mTORC1 pathways in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.",
    "issue": "9(9)",
    "pages": "1255-65",
    "abstract": "mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is implicated in cell growth control and is extensively regulated. We previously reported that in response to hypoxia, mTORC1 is inhibited by the protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1). REDD1 is upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, and forced REDD1 expression is sufficient to inhibit mTORC1. REDD1-induced mTORC1 inhibition is dependent on a protein complex formed by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and 2 (TSC2) proteins. In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is frequently inactivated leading to constitutive activation of HIF-2 and/or HIF-1, which may be expected to upregulate REDD1 and inhibit mTORC1. However, mTORC1 is frequently activated in ccRCC, and mTORC1 inhibitors are effective against this tumor type; a paradox herein examined. REDD1 was upregulated in VHL-deficient ccRCC by in silico microarray analyses, as well as by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Vhl disruption in a mouse model was sufficient to induce Redd1. Using ccRCC-derived cell lines, we show that REDD1 upregulation in tumors is VHL dependent and that both HIF-1 and HIF-2 are, in a cell-type-dependent manner, recruited to, and essential for, REDD1 induction. Interestingly, whereas mTORC1 is responsive to REDD1 in some tumors, strategies have evolved in others, such as mutations disrupting TSC1, to subvert mTORC1 inhibition by REDD1. Sequencing analyses of 77 ccRCCs for mutations in TSC1, TSC2, and REDD1, using PTEN as a reference, implicate the TSC1 gene, and possibly REDD1, as tumor suppressors in sporadic ccRCC. Understanding how ccRCCs become refractory to REDD1-induced mTORC1 inhibition should shed light into the development of ccRCC and may aid in patient selection for molecular-targeted therapies.",

    "pages": "1053-1070",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disease caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations and subsequent activation of the mTORC1 kinase. Upon mTORC1 activation, anabolic metabolism, which requires mitochondria, is induced, yet at the same time the principal pathway for mitochondrial turnover, autophagy, is compromised. How mTORC1 activation impacts mitochondrial turnover in neurons remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate impaired mitochondrial homeostasis in neuronal in vitro and in vivo models of TSC. We find that Tsc1/2-deficient neurons accumulate mitochondria in cell bodies, but are depleted of axonal mitochondria, including those supporting presynaptic sites. Axonal and global mitophagy of damaged mitochondria is impaired, suggesting that decreased turnover may act upstream of impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, blocking mTORC1 or inducing mTOR-independent autophagy restores mitochondrial homeostasis. Our study clarifies the complex relationship between the TSC-mTORC1 pathway, autophagy, and mitophagy, and defines mitochondrial homeostasis as a therapeutic target for TSC and related diseases.",

    "title": "mTOR inhibition improves the immunomodulatory properties of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by inducing COX-2 and PGE2.",
    "issue": "8(1)",
    "pages": "292",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders due to their profound immunomodulatory properties. However, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs needs activation by an inflammatory microenvironment, which may negatively impact the therapeutic effect because of increased immunogenicity. Here we explore the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling on the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs, and its impact on immunogenicity in the inflammatory microenvironment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHuman bone marrow MSCs were cocultured with activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD4+ T cells, and mouse splenocytes to evaluate the immunosuppressive function. Immunosuppressive factors were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was detected by flow cytometry. Short hairpin (sh)RNA was used to downregulate tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2, TSC1, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in MSCs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInhibition of mTOR signaling using rapamycin enhanced the immunosuppressive functions of MSCs, while prolonged exposure to rapamycin did not. The enhancement of the immunosuppressive function was independent of the inflammatory microenvironment, and occurred mainly through the upregulation of COX-2 and prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) expression. Furthermore, mTOR inhibition did not impact the immunogenicity of MSCs. However, the upregulated expression of MHC class II molecules by interferon (IFN)-γ was attenuated by mTOR inhibition, whereas TSC2 knockdown had the opposite effect.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results reveal that the mTOR signaling pathway regulates MSC immunobiology, and short-term exposure to rapamycin could be a novel approach to improve the MSC-based therapeutic effect.",

    "pages": "478-87",
    "abstract": "Balloon cells (BCs) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and giant cells (GCs) in tubers of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) share phenotypic similarities. TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations in TSC lead to mTOR pathway activation and p70S6kinase (phospho-S6K) and ribosomal S6 (phospho-S6) protein phosphorylation. Phospho-S6K, phospho-S6, and phospho-S6K-activated proteins phospho-STAT3 and phospho-4EBP1 were detected immunohistochemically in GCs, whereas only phospho-S6 was observed in BCs. Expression of four candidate gene families (cell signaling, cell adhesion, growth factor/receptor, and transcription factor mRNAs) was assayed in single, microdissected phospho-S6-immunolabeled BCs and GCs as a strategy to define whether BCs and GCs exhibit differential transcriptional profiles. Among 60 genes, differential expression of 24 mRNAs distinguished BCs from GCs and only 4 genes showed similar expression profiles between BCs and GCs. Tuberin mRNA levels were reduced in GCs from TSC patients with TSC2 gene mutations but were unchanged in BCs. Phospho-S6K, -S6, -STAT3, and -4EBP1 expression in GCs reflects loss of hamartin-tuberin-mediated mTOR pathway inhibition. Phospho-S6 expression alone in BCs does not support mTOR cascade activation in FCD. Differential gene expression profiles in BCs and GCs supports the hypothesis that these cell types derive by distinct pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls growth and survival in response to metabolic cues. Oxidative stress affects mTORC1 via inhibitory and stimulatory inputs. Whereas downregulation of TSC1-TSC2 activates mTORC1 upon oxidative stress, the molecular mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition remains unknown. Here, we identify astrin as an essential negative mTORC1 regulator in the cellular stress response. Upon stress, astrin inhibits mTORC1 association and recruits the mTORC1 component raptor to stress granules (SGs), thereby preventing mTORC1-hyperactivation-induced apoptosis. In turn, balanced mTORC1 activity enables expression of stress factors. By identifying astrin as a direct molecular link between mTORC1, SG assembly, and the stress response, we establish a unifying model of mTORC1 inhibition and activation upon stress. Importantly, we show that in cancer cells, apoptosis suppression during stress depends on astrin. Being frequently upregulated in tumors, astrin is a potential clinically relevant target to sensitize tumors to apoptosis.",

    "pages": "843-8",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) gene and is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. Even individuals with tuberous sclerosis and a normal intelligence quotient (approximately 50%) are commonly affected with specific neuropsychological problems, including long-term and working memory deficits. Here we report that mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2(+/-) mice) show deficits in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits in Tsc2(+/-) mice emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures, demonstrating that other disease mechanisms are involved. We show that hyperactive hippocampal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling led to abnormal long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and consequently to deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning. These deficits included impairments in two spatial learning tasks and in contextual discrimination. Notably, we show that a brief treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in adult mice rescues not only the synaptic plasticity, but also the behavioral deficits in this animal model of tuberous sclerosis. The results presented here reveal a biological basis for some of the cognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis, and they show that treatment with mTOR antagonists ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of this disorder.",

    "issue": "6(4)",
    "pages": "e19103",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm characterized by the dysregulated expression of angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines. The driving force of the KS lesion, the KSHV-infected spindle cell, secretes elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), essential for KS development. However, the origin of VEGF in this tumor remains unclear.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nHere we report that the KSHV G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) upregulates VEGF in KS through an intricate paracrine mechanism. The cytokines secreted by the few vGPCR-expressing tumor cells activate in neighboring cells multiple pathways (including AKT, ERK, p38 and IKKβ) that, in turn, converge on TSC1/2, promoting mTOR activation, HIF upregulation, and VEGF secretion. Conditioned media from vGPCR-expressing cells lead to an mTOR-dependent increase in HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels and VEGF upregulation. In a mouse allograft model for KS, specific inhibition of the paracrine activation of mTOR in non-vGPCR-expressing cells was sufficient to inhibit HIF upregulation in these cells, and abolished the ability of the vGPCR-expressing cells to promote tumor formation in vivo. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of HIF in this model blocked VEGF secretion and also lead to tumor regression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nOur findings provide a compelling explanation for how the few tumor cells expressing vGPCR can contribute to the dramatic amplification of VEGF secretion in KS, and further provide a molecular mechanism for how cytokine dysregulation in KS fuels angiogenesis and tumor development. These data further suggest that activation of HIF by vGPCR may be a vulnerable target for the treatment of patients with KS.",

    "issue": "190(1)",
    "pages": "158-175",
    "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption induces adipose tissue atrophy. However, the mechanisms for how alcohol induces lipodystrophy and its impact on liver steatosis and injury are not fully elucidated. Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, which regulates cellular homeostasis. Mice with autophagy deficiency in adipose tissue have impaired adipogenesis. However, whether autophagy plays a role in alcohol-induced adipose atrophy and how altered adipocyte autophagy contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury remain unclear. To determine the role of adipose autophagy and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in alcohol-induced adipose and liver pathogenesis, we generated adipocyte-specific Atg5 knockout (KO), adipocyte-specific mTOR KO, adipocyte-specific Raptor KO, and adipocyte-specific tuberous sclerosis complex 1 KO mice by crossing floxed mice with Adipoq-Cre. The KO mice and their matched wild-type mice were challenged with chronic-plus-binge alcohol mouse model. Chronic-plus-binge alcohol induced adipose atrophy with increased autophagy and decreased Akt/mTOR signaling in epididymal adipose tissue in wild-type mice. Adipocyte-specific Raptor KO mice experienced exacerbated alcohol-induced steatosis, but neither adipocyte-specific mTOR nor adipocyte-specific tuberous sclerosis complex 1 KO mice exhibited similar detrimental effects. Adipocyte-specific Atg5 KO mice had increased circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 and adiponectin and were resistant to alcohol-induced adipose atrophy and liver injury. In conclusion, autophagy deficiency in adipose tissue leads to reduced sensitivity to alcohol-induced adipose atrophy, which ameliorates alcohol-induced liver injury in mice.",

    "issue": "46(2)",
    "pages": "210-6",
    "abstract": "Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) integrates monoclonally into the genomes of approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs), affecting their clinicopathological features. The molecular mechanisms underlying MCC development after MCPyV infection remain unclear. We investigated the association of MCPyV infection with activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) signaling pathway in MCCs to elucidate the role of these signal transductions and to identify molecular targets for treatment. We analyzed the molecular and pathological characteristics of 41 MCPyV-positive and 27 MCPyV-negative MCCs. Expression of mTOR, TSC1, and TSC2 messenger RNA was significantly higher in MCPyV-negative MCCs, and Akt (T308) phosphorylation also was significantly higher (92% vs 66%; P = .019), whereas 4E-BP1 (S65 and T70) phosphorylation was common in both MCC types (92%-100%). The expression rates of most other tested signals were high (60%-100%) and not significantly correlated with MCPyV large T antigen expression. PIK3CA mutations were observed more frequently in MCPyV-positive MCCs (6/36 [17%] vs 2/20 [10%]). These results suggest that protein expression (activation) of most Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway signals was not significantly different in MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative MCCs, although these 2 types may differ in tumorigenesis, and MCPyV-negative MCCs showed significantly more frequent p-Akt (T308) activation. Therefore, certain Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway signals could be novel therapeutic targets for MCC regardless of MCPyV infection status.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nRenal cell carcinomas (RCC) with overlapping histomorphologic features poses diagnostic challenges. This is exemplified in RCCs with eosinophilic cytoplasm that include eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC (ESC RCC), RCCs in germline aberrations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes mutated (TSC RCC) individuals, and other RCC subtypes. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to molecularly profile seven ESC RCC tumors. Mutational and copy number analysis of NGS data revealed mutually exclusively somatic bi-allelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 genes-both negative regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in 85% (6/7) of evaluated cases. Thus, lack of germline TSC aberration in matched non-neoplastic renal parenchyma distinguishes ESC RCC from TSC RCC. Immunohistochemistry data shows mTOR pathway activation in all tumors, thus supporting a pathognomonic role for TSC aberrations in ESC RCC. Our study clarifies the molecular identity of ESC RCC, provides basis for the revision of current RCC classification, and may guide future therapeutic strategies.\n\n\nPATIENT SUMMARY\nMolecular characterization of eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinomas (ESC RCC) revealed recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic homozygous loss of tuberous sclerosis complex family genes. This observation provides greater insight into the unique biology of this novel type of tumor and potentially expands the therapeutic options for ESC RCC patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo conduct a phase II trial of the combination of carboplatin, prednisone, and everolimus in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) as mTOR inhibition can overcome resistance to chemotherapy in prostate cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with progressive mCRPC pretreated with docetaxel-based regimen were eligible. Performance status of 0-1 and adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function were required. Primary end point was time to progression. Treatment consisted of carboplatin (starting dose equal to area under the curve (AUC of 5) intravenously every 21 days along with oral everolimus 5 mg once daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-six patients were enrolled with median age of 69 years with 8 patients of African American origin. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in 4 of 6 initial patients required dose adjustment of carboplatin to AUC of 4 for subsequent patients. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions between carboplatin and everolimus. The median time to progression was 2.5 months (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-4.3 months), and median overall survival was 12.5 months (90% CI, 7.7-18.7 months). Of 10 patients, 8 that demonstrated positive nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) staining on immunohistochemistry progressed within 9 weeks, whereas 2 patients with negative staining continued without progression for prolonged durations of 30 and 48 weeks. TSC1 gene mutations did not correlate with clinical outcome.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to carboplatin demonstrated minimal clinical efficacy in metastatic prostate cancer. pAKT testing warrants further evaluation as a predictive marker of response to everolimus therapy.",

    "abstract": "Balloon cells of distinct focal cortical dysplasias type IIb (FCD(IIb)) and giant cells of cortical tubers in tuberous sclerosis (TSC) constitute neuropathological hallmarks and cytological similarities. In TSC, frequent mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes result in mTOR-signaling activity. Here, we addressed whether Pi3K-pathway activation differentiates balloon cells from giant cells. We used immunohistochemistry with antibodies against p-PDK1 (S241), p-Akt (S473), p-tuberin (T1462), p-p70(S6K) (T389), p-p70(S6K) (T229) and phalloidin-staining to analyze stress fiber formation in balloon cells of FCD(IIb) (n = 23) compared with cortical tuber giant cells (n = 5) and adjacent normal CNS tissue as control. We have further established an in vitro assay to assess potential phosphorylation between Akt and S6. We observed phosphorylated (p-)PDK1, p-Akt, p-tuberin, and p-p70-kDa S6-kinase (p-p70(S6K); residue T229) in balloon cells, whereas giant cells showed only equivalent levels of p-tuberin, p-p70(S6K) and stress fibers. Furthermore, Pi3K-cascade activity in balloon cells may reflect pathway \"cross-talk\". An in vitro assay revealed S6, a major target of p70(S6K), to increase phosphorylation of Akt. Our data suggest recruitment of different Pi3K-cascade factors in the molecular pathogenesis of giant cells in cortical tubers vs. balloon cells in FCD(IIb) and provides new implications for the development of treatment strategies for these cortical malformations.",

    "issue": "11()",
    "pages": "972",
    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipomas are one of the most common renal manifestations in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), with potentially life-threatening complications and a poor prognosis. Despite the considerable progress in understanding TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas, there are no large scale real-world data. The aim of our present study was to describe in detail the prevalence and outcome of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with TSC, enrolled into the TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) from 170 sites across 31 countries worldwide. We also sought to evaluate the relationship of TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas with age, gender and genotype. The potential risk factors for renal angiomyolipoma-related bleeding and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were studied in patients who participated in the TOSCA renal angiomyolipoma substudy. Of the 2,211 eligible patients, 1,062 (48%) reported a history of renal angiomyolipomas. The median age of TSC diagnosis for the all subjects (n = 2,211) was 1 year. The median age of diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma in the 1,062 patients was 13 years. Renal angiomyolipomas were significantly more prevalent in female patients (p < 0.0001). Rates of angiomyolipomas >3 cm (p = 0.0119), growing lesions (p = 0.0439), and interventions for angiomyolipomas (p = 0.0058) were also higher in females than males. Pre-emptive intervention for renal angiomyolipomas with embolisation, surgery, or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor may have abolished the gender difference in impaired renal function, hypertension, and other complications. The rate of interventions for angiomyolipomas was less common in children than in adults, but interventions were reported in all age groups. In the substudy of 76 patients the complication rate was too low to be useful in predicting risk for more severe CKD. In addition, in this substudy no patient had a renal hemorrhage after commencing on an mTOR inhibitor. Our findings confirmed that renal angiomyolipomas in subjects with TSC1 mutations develop on average at the later age, are relatively smaller in size and less likely to be growing; however, by age 40 years, no difference was observed in the percentage of patients with TSC1 and TSC2 mutations needing intervention. The peak of appearance of new renal angiomyolipomas was observed in patients aged between 18 and 40 years, but, given that angiomyolipomas can occur later, lifelong surveillance is necessary. We found that pre-emptive intervention was dramatically successful in altering the outcome compared to historical controls; with high pre-emptive intervention rates but low rates of bleeding and other complications. This validates the policy of surveillance and pre-emptive intervention recommended by clinical guidelines.",

    "issue": "13(3)",
    "pages": "548-55",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal disease caused by inactivating mutations in either of the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. TSC-associated tumor growth is present in multiple tissues and organs including brain, kidney, liver, heart, lungs, and skin. In the kidney, TSC angiomyolipomas have aberrant vascular structures with abnormal endothelial cells, suggesting a role for endothelial mTORC1 function. In the current report, a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with a conditional knockout allele of Tsc1 with a Darpp32-Cre allele displayed accelerated formation of both kidney cystadenomas and paw hemangiosarcomas. All mutant mice developed hemangiosarcomas on multiple paws by 6 weeks of age. By 16 weeks of age, the average mutant hind paw was 4.0 mm in diameter, nearly double the size of control mice. Furthermore, the hemangiosarcomas and kidney cystadenomas were responsive to intraperitoneal rapamycin treatment. Immunoblotting and immunostaining for phospho-S6 (pS6) and phospho-CAD showed that the effect of rapamycin on tumor size was through inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, elevated VEGF mRNA levels were also observed in hemangiosarcoma specimens. Because paw hemangiosarcomas are easily detectable and scorable for size and growth, this novel mouse model enables accelerated in vivo drug testing for therapies of TSC-related tumors.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThese findings provide a strong rationale for simultaneous use of this conditional knockout mouse as an in vivo genetic model while seeking new cancer therapies for TSC-related tumors.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to various upstream signals. Hypoxia has been shown to exert a strong inhibitory effect on mTORC1 activity. Various mechanisms involving gene transcription have been proposed to mediate the effect of hypoxia on mTORC1 activity. Here we show that oxygen concentrations regulate mTORC1 activity in a highly dynamic manner. The rapid response of mTORC1 to changes in oxygen concentrations was not mediated by the HIF transcription factor or its transcriptional targets, REDD1 and BNIP3. Interestingly, we observed that the rapid response of mTORC1 activity to changes in oxygen concentrations is independent of transcription and new protein synthesis. This suggests a post-translational regulation mTORC1 activity in hypoxia and reoxygenation. We also provide evidence that hypoxia does not regulate mTORC1 via the TSC1/2 or Ragulator pathways but directly at the level of mTORC1. In conclusion, our results suggest that mTORC1 can respond rapidly to changes in oxygen concentrations via a post-translational mechanism that may involve a heme containing protein.",

    "title": "Striatal Transcriptome and Interactome Analysis of Shank3-overexpressing Mice Reveals the Connectivity between Shank3 and mTORC1 Signaling.",
    "issue": "10()",
    "pages": "201",
    "abstract": "Mania causes symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, elevated mood, reduced anxiety and decreased need for sleep, which suggests that the dysfunction of the striatum, a critical component of the brain motor and reward system, can be causally associated with mania. However, detailed molecular pathophysiology underlying the striatal dysfunction in mania remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the molecular pathways showing alterations in the striatum of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3)-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice that display manic-like behaviors. The results of transcriptome analysis suggested that mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling may be the primary molecular signature altered in the Shank3 TG striatum. Indeed, we found that striatal mTORC1 activity, as measured by mTOR S2448 phosphorylation, was significantly decreased in the Shank3 TG mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, we re-analyzed previously reported protein interactomes, and detected a high connectivity between Shank3 and several upstream regulators of mTORC1, such as tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), TSC2 and Ras homolog enriched in striatum (Rhes), via 94 common interactors that we denominated \"Shank3-mTORC1 interactome\". We noticed that, among the 94 common interactors, 11 proteins were related to actin filaments, the level of which was increased in the dorsal striatum of Shank3 TG mice. Furthermore, we could co-immunoprecipitate Shank3, Rhes and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) proteins from the striatal lysate of Shank3 TG mice. By comparing with the gene sets of psychiatric disorders, we also observed that the 94 proteins of Shank3-mTORC1 interactome were significantly associated with bipolar disorder (BD). Altogether, our results suggest a protein interaction-mediated connectivity between Shank3 and certain upstream regulators of mTORC1 that might contribute to the abnormal striatal mTORC1 activity and to the manic-like behaviors of Shank3 TG mice.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional complex and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key regulators of translation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to energy deprivation. Furthermore, TSC2 and its phosphorylation by AMPK protect cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate a model where TSC2 functions as a key player in regulation of the common mTOR pathway of protein synthesis, cell growth, and viability in response to cellular energy levels.",

    "abstract": "Deviations from the optimal level of mRNA translation are linked to disorders with high rates of autism. Loss of function mutations in genes encoding translational repressors such as PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, and FMRP are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans and their deletion in animals recapitulates many ASD-like phenotypes. Importantly, the activity of key translational control signaling pathways such as PI3K-mTORC1 and ERK is frequently dysregulated in autistic patients and animal models and their normalization rescues many abnormal phenotypes, suggesting a causal relationship. Mutations in several genes encoding proteins not directly involved in translational control have also been shown to mediate ASD phenotypes via altered signaling upstream of translation. This raises the possibility that the dysregulation of translational control signaling is a converging mechanism not only in familiar but also in sporadic forms of autism. Here, we overview the current knowledge on translational signaling in ASD and highlight how correcting the activity of key pathways upstream of translation reverses distinct ASD-like phenotypes.",

    "issue": "12()",
    "pages": "627672",
    "abstract": "Background: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition that causes benign tumors to grow in multiple organ systems. Nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are a rare clinical feature of TSC with no specific guidelines outlined for clinical management at this time. Our purpose is to calculate the frequency of nonfunctional PNETs as well as characterize the presentation, current clinical management, and assess the impact of systemic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) on nonfunctional PNETs in TSC. Methods: This retrospective chart review was performed by a query of the TS Alliance's Natural History Database and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital TSC Database for patients with nonfunctional PNET. Clinical data from these two groups was summarized for patients identified to have a nonfunctional PNET and compared to previously reported cases with TSC and nonfunctional PNETs. Results: Our calculated frequency of nonfunctional PNETs is 0.65%. We identified 16 individuals, nine males and seven females, with a median age of 18.0 years (interquartile range: -15.5 to 25.5). Just over half (56.3%, n = 9) of the patients provided results from genetic testing. Six had pathogenic variants in TSC2 whereas three had pathogenic variants in TSC1. The average age at PNET diagnosis was 15.0 years (range: 3-46 years). Almost all individuals were diagnosed with a PNET during routine TSC surveillance, 56.3% (n = 9) by MRI, 12.5% (n = 2) by CT, 25% (n = 4) by ultrasound, and 6.2% (n = 1) through a surgical procedure. Follow up after diagnosis involved 68.8% (n = 11) having serial imaging and nine of the sixteen individuals proceeding with surgical removal of the PNET. Eight individuals had a history of using systemic mTOR inhibitors. Tumor growth rate was slightly less in individuals taking an mTOR inhibitor (-0.8 mm/yr, IQR: -2.3 to 2.2) than those without (1.6 mm/yr; IQR: -0.99 to 5.01, p > 0.05). Conclusions: Nonfunctional PNETs occurred at younger ages in our TSC cohort and more commonly compared to ages and prevalence reported for the general population. PNETs in patients on systemic mTOR inhibitors had lower rates of growth. The outcome of this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of mTOR inhibitor therapy in conjunction with serial imaging as medical management for nonfunctional PNETs as an alternative option to invasive surgical removal.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is a disease caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode a protein complex that inhibits mTOR kinase signaling by inactivating the Rheb GTPase. Activation of mTOR promotes the formation of benign tumors in various organs and the mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms of the disease remain largely unknown. We found that Tsc2 haploinsufficiency in mice caused aberrant retinogeniculate projections that suggest defects in EphA receptor-dependent axon guidance. We also found that EphA receptor activation by ephrin-A ligands in neurons led to inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and decreased inhibition of Tsc2 by ERK1/2. Thus, ephrin stimulation inactivates the mTOR pathway by enhancing Tsc2 activity. Furthermore, Tsc2 deficiency and hyperactive Rheb constitutively activated mTOR and inhibited ephrin-induced growth cone collapse. Our results indicate that TSC2-Rheb-mTOR signaling cooperates with the ephrin-Eph receptor system to control axon guidance in the visual system.",

    "title": "Insight into mechanism of oxidative DNA damage in angiomyolipomas from TSC patients.",
    "issue": "8()",
    "pages": "13",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by defects in one of two tumor suppressor genes, TSC-1 or TSC-2. TSC-2 gene encodes tuberin, a protein involved in the pathogenesis of kidney tumors, both angiomyolipomas and renal cell carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity at the 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) allele is found in human kidney clear cell carcinoma identifying loss of OGG1 function as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis in the kidney. Tuberin regulates OGG1 through the transcription factor NF-YA in cultured cells. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of tuberin-deficiency on OGG1 protein and mRNA levels as well as on 8-oxodG levels in kidney tumors from patients with TSC. In addition we evaluated the phophorylation level of downstream targets of mTOR, phospho-S70K, in kidney tumor tissue from TSC patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKidney angiomyolipoma tissue from TSC patients expresses significant levels of phopho-tuberin and low levels of tuberin compared to control kidney tissue. The increase in tuberin phosphorylation and the decrease tuberin expression are associated with decrease in OGG1 protein and mRNA levels in tumor samples compared to normal kidney samples. The decrease OGG1 expression is also associated with significant decrease in the transcription factor, NF-YA, expression in tumor samples compared to normal tissues. In addition, the levels of 8-oxodG are 4-fold higher in tumors compared to control samples. The significant increase of phospho-tuberin expression is associated with increase phosphorylation of S6K in tumor samples compared to controls. Cyclin D1 expression is also 3-fold higher in increase in the tumor tissues compared to normal kidney tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data indicate that tuberin deficiency in angiomyolipoma enhances mTOR activation by phosphorylation of S6K and downregulation of protein and mRNA expression of OGG1 resulted in accumulation of oxidized DNA in patients with TSC. These data suggest that tuberin and OGG1 are important proteins in the pathogenesis of angiomyolipoma in TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades are often activated by genetic alterations in upstream signaling molecules such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). Certain components of these pathways, RAS, NF1, BRAF, MEK1, DUSP5, PP2A, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, PIK3R5, IRS4, AKT, NFKB1, MTOR, PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 may also be activated/inactivated by mutations or epigenetic silencing. Upstream mutations in one signaling pathway or even in downstream components of the same pathway can alter the sensitivity of the cells to certain small molecule inhibitors. These pathways have profound effects on proliferative, apoptotic and differentiation pathways. Dysregulation of components of these cascades can contribute to: resistance to other pathway inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drug resistance, premature aging as well as other diseases. This review will first describe these pathways and discuss how genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations can result in resistance to various inhibitors.",

    "issue": "163(6)",
    "pages": "1238-44",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop fibrous tumours in the brain, skin, kidney, heart and lungs due to TSC1/2 mutations. In the skin, patients develop angiofibromas that have vascular and fibrotic components in which transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 are important.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo investigate if the TGF-β axis and MMP-2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of TSC angiofibromas.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSamples from TSC angiofibromas and normal skin were measured for expression of TGF-β and MMP-2 by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fibroblasts grown from TSC angiofibromas (TSC fibroblasts) were incubated with TGF-β. Expression of ERK, AKT and S6K was measured by Western blotting, and MMP-2 expression and activity were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gelatin zymography, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an increase in the expression of TGF-β and MMP-2 in TSC tumours compared with those in normal skin. The baseline expression of MMP-2 was increased in conditioned medium from TSC fibroblasts. In addition, TGF-β enhanced MMP-2 production and activity, which could be abrogated by pretreatment with an AKT inhibitor (LY294002) but not with rapamycin. Finally, there was a significant colocalization of TGF-β and MMP-2 in the TSC tumours.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an increase of MMP-2 as a result of TGF-β acting through AKT in TSC tumour cells. This regulation of the TGF-β-AKT-MMP-2 axis is independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. In addition to targeting the mTOR pathway, targeting TGF-β simultaneously could block dysregulated tissue remodelling in TSC tumours.",

    "title": "Receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signalling analysis in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.",
    "issue": "46(15)",
    "pages": "2837-48",
    "abstract": "Our aim was to assess the activation profile of EGFR, PDGFRB and PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and their downstream effectors in a series of cryopreserved diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) surgical specimens to discover the targets for drug inhibition. We also made a complementary analysis of the cytotoxic effects of some kinase inhibitors on the proliferation of the human peritoneal mesothelioma STO cell line. We found the expression/phosphorylation of EGFR and PDGFRB in most of the tumours, and PDGFRA activation in half. The expression of the cognate ligands TGF-α, PDGFB and PDGFA in the absence of RTK mutation and amplification suggested the presence of an autocrine/paracrine loop. There was also evidence of EGFR and PDGFRB co-activation. RTK downstream signalling analysis demonstrated the activation/expression of ERK1/2, AKT and mTOR, together with S6 and 4EBP1, in almost all the DMPMs. No KRAS/BRAF mutations, PI3KCA mutations/amplifications or PTEN inactivation were observed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed the decreased expression of TSC1 c-DNA in half of the tumours. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed the STO cell line to be resistant to gefitinib and sensitive to sequential treatment with RAD001 and sorafenib; these findings were consistent with the presence of the KRAS mutation G12D in these cells although it was not detectable in the original tumour. Our results highlight the ligand-dependent activation and co-activation of EGFR and PDGFRB, as well as a connection between these activated RTKs and the downstream mTOR pathway, thus supporting the role of combined treatment with RTK and mTOR inhibitors in DMPM.",

    "issue": "7()",
    "pages": "14",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hamartoma disorder with variable expression for which treatment options are limited. TSC is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose products, hamartin and tuberin, function as negative regulators in the highly-conserved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), an mTOR inhibitor, has been shown to reduce disease severity in rodent models of TSC and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in human populations. The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is also a potential therapeutic agent for TSC. A high-expressing IFN-gamma allele has been associated with reduced disease severity in human TSC patients and it has been shown in mouse models that treatment with exogenous IFN-gamma reduces disease severity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we examine the effects of treating Tsc2+/- mice at different time points with a rapamycin analog (CCI-779) as a single agent or with a combination of CCI-779 and IFN-gamma. We observed that administering a short course of CCI-779 or CCI-779 plus IFN-gamma reduced the severity of kidney lesions if administered after such lesions develop. As long as treatment is given after lesions arise, altering the time period during which treatment was given did not significantly impact the effect of the treatment on disease severity. We did not observe a significant benefit of combination therapy relative to treatment with a rapamycin analog alone in Tsc2+/- mice. We also compared timing of treatment and two mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and CCI-779) in nude mice bearing Tsc2-/- tumors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPreventing the genesis of TSC-related kidney lesions in Tsc2+/- mice is not an effective treatment strategy; rather, the presence of growing tumors appears to be the most important factor when determining an appropriate treatment schedule. Treatment with rapamycin was more effective in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in nude mice bearing Tsc2-/- tumors and also resulted in higher rapamycin levels in blood, brain, and kidney tissue than treatment with an equal milligram dose of CCI-779. We anticipate these results will influence future preclinical and clinical trials for TSC.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to selectively profile the activation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-associated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in ovarian cancer specimens, healthy ovaries and benign ovarian tumors, including endometrial cysts. We used a novel type of microfluidic gene array to examine the expression of 15 human tumor suppressors and oncogenes in ovarian cancer specimens of 53 patients, benign ovarian cysts of 29 women (endometrial and simple) and 11 healthy ovaries of individuals in whom the material was obtained during total hysterectomies performed because of fibroid changes. The array was custom-designed to include the following genes: NF1, RHEB, mTOR1, AKT-1, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, KRAS, RPS6KB1, 4EBP1, TP53, EIF4E, STK11, PIK3CA and BECN1. Confirmatory immunohistochemical detection was performed for a group of selected proteins. Particularly significant differences were observed as to the expression of PTEN (p < 0.0001), TP53 (p = 0.0003), PIK3CA (p = 0.0003) and BECN1 (p = 0.0014) which were shown to be downregulated in cancer patients when compared to healthy ovaries and benign ovarian cysts (endometrial and simple). These markers did not show association with grade or stage of the tumor. Immunohistochemistry showed that PTEN, TP53, PIK3CA and BECN1 proteins are expressed in ovarian cancer. Our results indicate that there are significant differences in the expression of some of the mTOR-related tumor suppressors and oncogenes which could be associated with the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.",

    "issue": "101(3)",
    "pages": "616-23",
    "abstract": "Exposure to carcinogens early in life may contribute to cancer development later in life. The amount of radiation exposure children experience during medical procedures has been increasing, so it is important to evaluate the radiation risk of cancer in developing organs. Toward this goal, we assessed the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma using Eker rats as a kidney tumor model. F1 hybrids of male Eker (Tsc2 mutant) and female F344 rats were irradiated with 0.5 or 2 Gy gamma radiation on gestation days 15 and 19, and on postnatal days 5, 20, and 49. At 27 weeks of age, kidneys were examined for proliferative lesions. Preneoplastic lesions such as phenotypically altered tubules increased after postnatal irradiation as a function of age-at-irradiation, and hyperplasia were greatly increased after perinatal and postnatal irradiation. In contrast, development of adenoma and adenocarcinoma were evident in animals irradiated at perinatal ages, being maximal at gestational day 19. The frequency of LOH at the Tsc2 locus was unexpectedly low - 0% (0 of 4) for the unirradiated control, and 17% (6 of 35) for the irradiated group. Irrespective of LOH, the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which is negatively regulated by the Tsc1/2 complex, was activated in both benign and malignant lesions, as evidenced by phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1. This suggests that the wild-type Tsc2 allele may be functionally inactivated. In conclusion, actively growing kidneys in perinatal-aged (F344 x Eker) F1 rats (Tsc2(+/-)) are at risk for radiation-induced malignant transformation of the renal epithelium associated with mTOR activation.",

Malfunctional tsc1/tsc2 genes leave mTOR uninhibited, a positive downstream modulator of the innate proinflammatory immune system, which has not yet been described in pediatric patients with TSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene expression levels of monocytes after cultivation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with LPS + mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, patients with TSC (n = 16) were compared with healthy subjects (n = 20).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with monocytes from healthy controls, LPS showed a more prominent gene expression pattern in patients with TSC (CCL24, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1B). Proinflammatory reactions against LPS were modulated by rapamycin. With LPS + rapamycin monocytes from patients with TSC showed gene expression patterns different from healthy subjects. Furthermore, developmental differences were discernible in patients with TSC, compared with gene expression levels for patients 0 to 5 years to those 6 to 11 years of age, the latter with marked expression of IL-6 IL-1A, IL-1B, RIPK2, but also IL-10.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe effects of LPS, even more of LPS with rapamycin on monocytes from patients with TSC suggested that inflammatory processes are distinct from those in healthy subjects.

    "title": "Acute alcohol intoxication increases REDD1 in skeletal muscle.",
    "issue": "32(5)",
    "pages": "796-805",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe mechanism by which acute alcohol (EtOH) intoxication decreases basal muscle protein synthesis via inhibition of the Ser/Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is poorly defined. In this regard, mTOR activity is impaired after over expression of the regulatory protein REDD1. Hence, the present study assessed the ability of REDD1 as a potential mediator of the EtOH-induced decrease in muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effect of acute EtOH intoxication on REDD1 mRNA and protein was determined in striated muscle of rats and mouse myocytes using an RNase protection assay and Western blotting, respectively. Other components of the mTOR signaling pathway were also assessed by immunoblotting. For comparison, REDD1 mRNA/protein was also determined in the muscle of rats chronically fed an alcohol-containing diet for 14 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntraperitoneal (IP) injection of EtOH increased gastrocnemius REDD1 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and these changes were associated with reciprocal decreases in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which is a surrogate marker for mTOR activity and protein synthesis. No change in REDD1 mRNA was detected in the slow-twitch soleus muscle or heart. Acute EtOH produced comparable increases in muscle REDD1 protein. The EtOH-induced increase in gastrocnemius REDD1 was independent of the route of EtOH administration (oral vs. IP), the nutritional state (fed vs. fasted), gender, and age of the rat. The nonmetabolizable alcohol tert-butanol increased REDD1 and the EtOH-induced increase in REDD1 was not prevented by pretreatment with the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole. In contrast, REDD1 mRNA and protein were not increased in the isolated hindlimb perfused with EtOH or in C2C12 myocytes incubated with EtOH, under conditions previously reported to decrease protein synthesis. Pretreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 failed to prevent the EtOH-induced increase in REDD1. Finally, the EtOH-induced increase in REDD1 was not associated with altered formation of the TSC1*TSC2 complex or the phosphorylation of TSC2 which is down stream in the REDD1 stress response pathway. In contradistinction to the changes observed with acute EtOH intoxication, REDD1 mRNA/protein was not changed in gastrocnemius from chronic alcohol-fed rats despite the reduction in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate that in fast-twitch skeletal muscle (i) REDD1 mRNA/protein is increased in vivo by acute EtOH intoxication but not in response to chronic alcohol feeding, (ii) elevated REDD1 in response to acute EtOH appears due to the production of an unknown secondary mediator which is not corticosterone, and (iii) the EtOH-induced decrease in protein synthesis can be dissociated from a change in REDD1 suggesting that the induction of this protein is not responsible for the rapid decrease in protein synthesis after acute EtOH administration or for the development of alcoholic myopathy in rats fed an alcohol-containing diet.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates various cellular functions, including tumorigenesis, and is inhibited by the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)-TSC2 complex. Here, we demonstrate that arrest-defective protein 1 (ARD1) physically interacts with, acetylates, and stabilizes TSC2, thereby repressing mTOR activity. The inhibition of mTOR by ARD1 inhibits cell proliferation and increases autophagy, thereby inhibiting tumorigenicity. Correlation between ARD1 and TSC2 abundance was apparent in multiple tumor types. Moreover, evaluation of loss of heterozygosity at Xq28 revealed allelic loss in 31% of tested breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples. Together, our findings suggest that ARD1 functions as an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and that dysregulation of the ARD1-TSC2-mTOR axis may contribute to cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of multiple cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. Emerging evidence has shown that deregulation of this pathway has a role promoting gastric cancer (GC). The aim was to assess the expression of genes involved in this pathway by qPCR in 23 tumor and 23 non-tumor gastric mucosa samples from advanced GC patients, and in AGS, MKN28 and MKN45 gastric cancer cell lines. Results showed a slight overexpression of PIK3CA, PIK3CB, AKT1, MTOR, RPS6KB1, EIF4EBP1 and EIF4E genes, and a slightly decreased PTEN and TSC1 expression. In AGS, MKN28 and MKN45 cells a significant gene overexpression of PIK3CA, PIK3CB, AKT1, MTOR, RPS6KB1 and EIF4E, and a significant repression of PTEN gene expression were observed. Immunoblotting showed that PI3K-β, AKT, p-AKT, PTEN, mTOR, p-mTOR, P70S6K1, p-P70S6K1, 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1, eIF4E and p-eIF4E proteins were present in cell lines at different levels, confirming activation of this pathway in vitro. This is the first time this extensive panel of 9 genes within PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been studied in GC to clarify the biological role of this pathway in GC and develop new strategies for this malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Frequent alteration of upstream proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes activates mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and causes cancer. However, the downstream effectors of mTOR remain largely elusive. Here we report that brain-expressed X-linked 2 (BEX2) is a novel downstream effector of mTOR. Elevated BEX2 in Tsc2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Pten(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Tsc2-deficient rat uterine leiomyoma cells, and brains of neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice were abolished by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, BEX2 was also increased in the liver of a hepatic specific Pten knock-out mouse and the kidneys of Tsc2 heterozygous deletion mice, and a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). mTOR up-regulation of BEX2 was mediated in parallel by both STAT3 and NF-κB. BEX2 was involved in mTOR up-regulation of VEGF production and angiogenesis. Depletion of BEX2 blunted the tumorigenesis of cells with activated mTOR. Therefore, enhanced STAT3/NF-κB-BEX2-VEGF signaling pathway contributes to hyperactive mTOR-induced tumorigenesis. BEX2 may be targeted for the treatment of the cancers with aberrantly activated mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "pages": "382-7",
    "abstract": "Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is a key player in the regulation of cell growth and energy metabolism via the mTOR and PI3K signalling pathways. The activity and subcellular localization of S6K are regulated by multiple S/T phosphorylations in response to diverse extracellular stimuli. Downregulation of S6K signalling occurs through the action of S/T phosphatases (PP2A and PP1) and tumor suppressors (TSC1/2 and PTEN). We report here that, in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are ubiquitinated in cells. The pattern of ubiquitination and the effect of proteasomal inhibitors on the steady-state level of transiently overexpressed and endogenous S6Ks point to proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated S6Ks. Furthermore, we found that the site(s) of ubiquitination are located in the kinase domain and that the N- and C-terminal regulatory regions modulate the efficiency of S6K ubiquitination. This study suggests that S6K signalling also could be regulated through the proteasome-mediated turnover of S6Ks.",

    "abstract": "Low-grade oncocytic renal tumor (LOT) is an emerging provisional entity, described as rare solid renal oncocytic/eosinophilic tumor sharing diffuse CK7 and negative CD117 immunoprofile. The links between LOT and other eosinophilic chromophobe like-renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are currently discussed. We sequenced tumoral DNA with a next generation sequencing panel for kidney cancer and carried out immunohistochemical analyses with CK7, CD117, SDHB, 4EBP1-P, S6K-P, and FOXI1 antibodies in a series of ten cases of LOT (9 females, 1 male; mean age at surgery: 66 years, 42.3 to 83.4) retrospectively diagnosed from a cohort of 272 tumors initially classified as chromophobe RCC (CHRCC). All LOT were single, without known hereditary predisposition, classified stage pT1 (70%), pT2 (20%) or pT3a (10%). Morphological features were similar to previous descriptions and clinical behavior was indolent for the six cases with available follow-up. We identified genetic variations in mTOR pathway related genes in 80% of cases, MTOR (7 cases) or TSC1 (1 case). Expression of FOXI1 was absent in all cases. In 9 LOT, 4EBP1-P and S6K-P were overexpressed, suggesting mTOR pathway activation.Our data highlights the major role of mTOR pathway in tumorigenesis of LOT mostly due to activating MTOR gene variations. Absence of FOXI1 expression is a strong argument to distinguish LOT from eosinophilic CHRCC and to bring them closer to other recently described FOXI1 negative eosinophilic-CHRCC like with MTOR/TSC mutations. Altogether, our data argue to consider LOT as a distinct entity with a favorable clinical outcome. However, in case of metastasis, an accurate diagnosis of LOT would be essential for the patient's management and could allow targeted therapy.",

    "issue": "30(6)",
    "pages": "562-573",
    "abstract": "Subungual melanomas (SUM) arise beneath the nails of the hands and feet, and account for 0.7-3.5% of all malignant melanomas. Most studies include SUM in the category of acral melanoma, but understanding the specific features of SUM is critical for improving patient care. In this study, we performed a site-specific comparison of the clinical and molecular features between 54 cases of SUM and 78 cases of nonsubungual acral melanoma. Compared to patients with acral melanoma, patients with SUM were younger at diagnosis, had a higher prevalence of primary melanomas on the hand, and had more frequent reports of previous trauma at the tumor site. SUM was deeper than acral melanoma at diagnosis, which correlated with an increased frequency of metastases. Analysis of common melanoma driver genes revealed KIT and KRAS mutations were predominantly found in SUM, whereas BRAF and NRAS mutations occurred almost exclusively in acral melanoma. We also discovered molecular differences in the cell cycle pathway, where CDK4/CCND1 amplifications were more frequent in SUM and CDKN2A/B loss occurred mostly in acral melanoma, and in the PI3K/mTOR pathway, where RICTOR amplification and TSC1 K587R mutations were exclusively in SUM and PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations were exclusively in acral melanoma. Comparison of hand versus foot tumors revealed more frequent ulceration of SUM foot tumors, which correlated with more distal metastases and poorer overall survival. In summary, we find SUM are both clinically and molecularly distinct from acral melanoma, and our data suggest KIT, CDK4/6, and mTOR inhibitors may be particularly relevant and effective treatments for patients with SUM.",

    "issue": "39(1)",
    "pages": "23-33",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGastric cancer (GC) is a deadly malignancy worldwide. In the past, it has been shown that cellular signaling pathway alterations play a crucial role in the development of GC. In particular, deregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway seems to affect multiple GC functions including growth, proliferation, metabolism, motility and angiogenesis. Targeting alterations in this pathway by microRNAs (miRNAs) represents a potential therapeutic strategy, especially in inhibitor-resistant tumors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of 3 pre-selected miRNAs, miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a, in a series of primary GC tissues and matched non-GC tissues and in several GC-derived cell lines, and to subsequently evaluate the functional role of these miRNAs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-five primary GC samples, 25 matched non-GC samples and 3 GC-derived cell lines, i.e., AGS, MKN28 and MKN45, were included in this study. miRNA and target gene expression levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Subsequently, cell viability, clone formation, cell death, migration and invasion assays were performed on AGS cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nmiR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a were found to be down-regulated in the primary GC tissues and the GC-derived cell lines tested. MiRNA mimic transfections significantly reduced cell viability and colony formation, increased cell death and reduced cell migration and invasion in AGS cells. We also found that exogenous expression of miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a decreased the expression of their putative targets MTOR, PIK3CB and TSC1, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur expression analyses and in vitro functional assays suggest that miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a act as potential tumor suppressors in primary GCs as well as in GC-derived AGS cells.",

    "issue": "10(3)",
    "pages": "e0116096",
    "abstract": "mTOR complex1, the major regulator of mRNA translation in all eukaryotic cells, is strongly activated in most cancers. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in a human cancer cell line, seeking genes that regulate S6 phosphorylation, readout of mTORC1 activity. Applying a stringent selection, we retrieved nearly 600 genes wherein at least two RNAis gave significant reduction in S6-P. This cohort contains known regulators of mTOR complex 1 and is significantly enriched in genes whose depletion affects the proliferation/viability of the large set of cancer cell lines in the Achilles database in a manner paralleling that caused by mTOR depletion. We next examined the effect of RNAi pools directed at 534 of these gene products on S6-P in TSC1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts. 76 RNAis reduced S6 phosphorylation significantly in 2 or 3 replicates. Surprisingly, among this cohort of genes the only elements previously associated with the maintenance of mTORC1 activity are two subunits of the vacuolar ATPase and the CUL4 subunit DDB1. RNAi against a second set of 84 targets reduced S6-P in only one of three replicates. However, an indication that this group also bears attention is the presence of rpS6KB1 itself, Rac1 and MAP4K3, a protein kinase that supports amino acid signaling to rpS6KB1. The finding that S6 phosphorylation requires a previously unidentified, functionally diverse cohort of genes that participate in fundamental cellular processes such as mRNA translation, RNA processing, DNA repair and metabolism suggests the operation of feedback pathways in the regulation of mTORC1 operating through novel mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRenal fibrosis is a chronic and progressive process affecting kidneys in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exo) have been shown to alleviate renal fibrosis and injury, but the mechanism of MSCs-Exo-induced renal protection remains unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this study, MSCs were transfected with let-7i-5p antagomir (anti-let-7i-5p), and then exosomes were isolated from the transfected MSCs to deliver anti-let-7i-5p oligonucleotides to inhibit the level of let-7i-5p in kidney tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both NRK-52E cells stimulated by TGF-β1 and the mouse kidneys after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), we demonstrated increased level of let-7i-5p. In addition, MSCs-Exo can deliver anti-let-7i-5p to reduce the level of let-7i-5p in NRK-52E cells and increase the expression of its target gene TSC1. Moreover, exosomal anti-let-7i-5p reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)-stimulated NRK-52E cells and in the kidneys of UUO-treated mice. Meanwhile, mice received exosomal anti-let-7i-5p displayed reduced renal fibrosis and improved kidney function when challenged with UUO. Furthermore, exosomal anti-let-7i-5p promoted the activation the tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1/mammalian target of rapamycin (TSC1/mTOR) signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, exosomal anti-let-7i-5p from MSCs exerts anti-fibrotic effects in TGF-β1-induced fibrogenic responses in NRK52E cells in vitro as well as in UUO-induced renal fibrosis model in vivo. These results provided a novel perspective on improving renal fibrosis by MSCs-Exo.",

Approximately 25% of AML patients carry FLT3 mutations and develop post-treatment insensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified LZTR1, NF1, TSC1 or TSC2, negative regulators of the MAPK and MTOR pathways, as mediators of sorafenib resistance. Analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity assays in FLT3-ITD AML patient samples revealed lower expression of LZTR1, NF1, and TSC2 correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. Importantly, MAPK and/or MTOR complex1 (MTORC1) activity were upregulated in AML cells made resistant to several FLT3 inhibitors, including crenolanib, quizartinib, or sorafenib. These cells were sensitive to MEK inhibitors, and the combination of FLT3 and MEK inhibitors showed enhanced efficacy, suggesting its effectiveness in AML patients with FLT3 mutations and those with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and results in the over-activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is clinically used to treat hamartomatous lesionsas in TSC and its effect on controlling epilepsy is also reported in many studies. This study aims to evaluate the risk factors of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC receiving long-term rapamycin treatment.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 108 patients with TSC taking rapamycin for over 1 year were enrolled in this study. Factors that might influence seizure control were statistically analyzed by multiple factor analysis. A subgroup analysis was also conducted to access the relationship between calcified epileptic foci and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. (Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR-OOB-15006535(2015-05-29)).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeizure was controlled in 53 patients but was not managed in 55 patients considered to be drug resistant. Logistic regression analysis showed that calcification in the cerebral parenchyma was a risk factor of pharmacoresistant epilepsy [P = 0.006, odds ratio (OR) = 4.831 (1.577, 14.795)]. Fifteen of 17 patients with calcified epileptic foci suffered from pharmacoresistant epilepsy (88.2%). Seizures in patients with calcified epileptic foci were probably pharmacoresistant (P = 0.010).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCalcification in epileptic foci strongly indicates pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC even when treated with appropriate anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and rapamycin. Calcification can be used to evaluate pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC.",

    "pages": "1183",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder with multisystemic involvement usually resulting from mutations in the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 genes. However, 10 to 25% of patients do not exhibit these mutations. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are capillary-venous malformations that can be asymptomatic or cause variable neurological manifestations, including seizures. Familial CCMs are recognized. In both conditions, specific dermatological lesions are associated. We present the case of a 31-year-old female with TSC diagnosed at the age of 18 years who presented with negative genetic testing. She was admitted to our department in 2019 for a sudden increased frequency of focal seizures. Patient examination revealed multiple facial and intraoral angiofibroma, diplopia, right hemihypoesthesia, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and distal leg paresthesia. VideoEEG indicated a frontal paramedian epileptogenic focus. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angioMRI identified multiple fronto-parietal cortical tubers, as well as multiple CCMs, with evidence of bleeding in one. Under antiepileptic drug (AED) and mTOR inhibitor treatment, the seizure frequency significantly improved in a short period of time. This is the first reported case of tuberous sclerosis with negative genetic testing associated with multiple cerebral cavernoma. Such complex patients require multidisciplinary management and detailed genetic testing for increasing knowledge on neuro-cutaneous disorders.",

    "abstract": "Genetic malformations of cortical development (MCDs), such as mild MCDs (mMCD), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and hemimegalencephaly (HME), are major causes of severe pediatric refractory epilepsies subjected to neurosurgery. FCD2 are characterized by neuropathological hallmarks that include enlarged dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells (BCs). Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the contribution of germline and somatic variants in a large cohort of surgical MCD cases. We enrolled in a monocentric study 80 children with drug-resistant epilepsy and a postsurgical neuropathological diagnosis of mMCD, FCD1, FCD2, or HME. We performed targeted gene sequencing ( ≥ 2000X read depth) on matched blood-brain samples to search for low-allele frequency variants in mTOR pathway and FCD genes. We were able to elucidate 29% of mMCD/FCD1 patients and 63% of FCD2/HME patients. Somatic loss-of-function variants in the N-glycosylation pathway-associated SLC35A2 gene were found in mMCD/FCD1 cases. Somatic gain-of-function variants in MTOR and its activators (AKT3, PIK3CA, RHEB), as well as germline, somatic and two-hit loss-of-function variants in its repressors (DEPDC5, TSC1, TSC2) were found exclusively in FCD2/HME cases. We show that panel-negative FCD2 cases display strong pS6-immunostaining, stressing that all FCD2 are mTORopathies. Analysis of microdissected cells demonstrated that DNs and BCs carry the pathogenic variants. We further observed a correlation between the density of pathological cells and the variant-detection likelihood. Single-cell microdissection followed by sequencing of enriched pools of DNs unveiled a somatic second-hit loss-of-heterozygosity in a DEPDC5 germline case. In conclusion, this study indicates that mMCD/FCD1 and FCD2/HME are two distinct genetic entities: while all FCD2/HME are mosaic mTORopathies, mMCD/FCD1 are not caused by mTOR-pathway-hyperactivating variants, and ~ 30% of the cases are related to glycosylation defects. We provide a framework for efficient genetic testing in FCD/HME, linking neuropathology to genetic findings and emphasizing the usefulness of molecular evaluation in the pediatric epileptic neurosurgical population.",

    "pages": "225-237",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, genetic disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. Patients with TSC are neurologically characterized by the presence of abnormal brain structure, intractable epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the lack of effective long-term treatments for TSC, there is a need to gain greater insight into TSC-related pathophysiology and to identify and develop new treatments. In this work we show that homozygous tsc2-/- mutant zebrafish larvae, but not tsc2+/- and WT larvae, display enlarged brains, reduced locomotor behavior and epileptiform discharges at 7dpf. In addition, we pharmacologically validated the TSC model by demonstrating the dramatic rescue effect of pericardially injected rapamycin, a well-known mTOR inhibitor, on selected behavioral read-outs and at the molecular level. By means of trancriptome profiling we also acquired more insight into the neuropathology of TSC, and as a result were able to highlight possible new treatment targets. The gene expression profiles of WT and tsc2+/- larvae revealed 117 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while between WT and tsc2-/- larvae and tsc2+/- and tsc2-/- larvae there were 1414 and 1079 DEGs, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis from the WT and tsc2-/- DEGs, identified 14 enriched pathways from the up-regulated genes and 6 enriched pathways from the down-regulated genes. Moreover, genes related to inflammation and immune response were up-regulated in the heads of tsc2-/- larvae, in line with the findings in human brain tissue where inflammatory and immune responses appear to be major hallmarks of TSC. Taken together, our phenotypic, transcriptomic and pharmacological analysis identified the tsc2-/- zebrafish as a preclinical model that mirrors well aspects of the human condition and delineated relevant TSC-related biological pathways. The model may be of value for future TSC-related drug discovery and development programs.",

    "issue": "9()",
    "pages": "8",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndrome, characterized by hamartomatous growths in the brain, skin, kidneys, lungs, and heart, which lead to significant morbidity. TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose products, hamartin and tuberin, form a tumor suppressor complex that regulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Early clinical trials show that TSC-related kidney tumors (angiomyolipomas) regress when treated with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus). Although side effects are tolerable, responses are incomplete, and tumor regrowth is common when rapamycin is stopped. Strategies for future clinical trials may include the investigation of longer treatment duration and combination therapy of other effective drug classes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we examine the efficacy of a prolonged maintenance dose of rapamycin in Tsc2+/- mice with TSC-related kidney tumors. Cohorts were treated with rapamycin alone or in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN-g). The schedule of rapamycin included one month of daily doses before and after five months of weekly doses. We observed a 94.5% reduction in kidney tumor burden in Tsc2+/- mice treated (part one) daily with rapamycin (8 mg/kg) at 6 months <or= age < 7 months, (part 2) weekly with rapamycin (16 mg/kg) at 7 months <or= age < 12 months, and (part 3) daily with rapamycin (8 mg/kg) at 12 months <or= age < 13 months; but we did not observe any improvement with combination IFN-g plus rapamycin in this study. We also used a Tsc2-/- subcutaneous tumor model to evaluate other classes of drugs including sorafenib, atorvastatin, and doxycycline. These drugs were tested as single agents and in combination with rapamycin. Our results demonstrate that the combination of rapamycin and sorafenib increased survival and may decrease tumor volume as compared to rapamycin treatment alone while sorafenib as a single agent was no different than control. Atorvastatin and doxycycline, either as single agents or in combination with rapamycin, did not improve outcomes as compared with controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results indicate that prolonged treatment with low doses of mTOR inhibitors may result in more complete and durable TSC-related tumor responses, and it would be reasonable to evaluate this strategy in a clinical trial. Targeting the Raf/Mek/Erk and/or VEGF pathways in combination with inhibiting the mTOR pathway may be another useful strategy for the treatment of TSC-related tumors.",

    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "In the connectivity map (CMap) approach to drug repositioning and development, transcriptional signature of disease is constructed by differential gene expression analysis between the diseased tissue or cells and the control. The negative correlation between the transcriptional disease signature and the transcriptional signature of the drug, or a bioactive compound, is assumed to indicate its ability to \"reverse\" the disease process. A major limitation of traditional CMaP analysis is the use of signatures derived from bulk disease tissues. Since the key driver pathways are most likely dysregulated in only a subset of cells, the \"averaged\" transcriptional signatures resulting from bulk analysis lack the resolution to effectively identify effective therapeutic agents. The use of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic assay facilitates construction of disease signatures that are specific to individual cell types, but methods for using scRNA-seq data in the context of CMaP analysis are lacking. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes result in the activation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The mTORC1 inhibitor Sirolimus is the only FDA-approved drug to treat LAM. Novel therapies for LAM are urgently needed as the disease recurs with discontinuation of the treatment and some patients are insensitive to the drug. We developed methods for constructing disease transcriptional signatures and CMaP analysis using scRNA-seq profiling and applied them in the analysis of scRNA-seq data of lung tissue from naïve and sirolimus-treated LAM patients. New methods successfully implicated mTORC1 inhibitors, including Sirolimus, as capable of reverting the LAM transcriptional signatures. The CMaP analysis mimicking standard bulk-tissue approach failed to detect any connection between the LAM signature and mTORC1 signaling. This indicates that the precise signature derived from scRNA-seq data using our methods is the crucial difference between the success and the failure to identify effective therapeutic treatments in CMaP analysis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWe aim to elucidate the disease impact by accounting the prevalence, survival rate, genetics, mTOR inhibitor use and direct costs of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in our local setting. TSC patients with documented visits to our local public hospitals in 1995-2018 were identified. The public hospitals captured most if not all local TSC patients. Demographics such as age, sex, death, genetic profiles were retrieved from the central electronic database. Data including prevalence, age distribution and survival rate were analysed. Direct cost was calculated with reference to the drug use and number of visits to various public hospital facilities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 284 surviving TSC patients (55.3% male) in Hong Kong. The age range was from 4.5 months to 89.9 years, with a median age of 27.2 years. Paediatrics (< 18 years) to adult (≥18 years) ratio was 1:2.84. The overall prevalence of TSC patients was 3.87 in 100,000 (i.e. 1 in 25,833). Genetically, TSC1:TSC2 ratio is 1:2.7. Thirty seven patients died within the study period. The age of death ranged from 7.6 years to 77.8 years, with a median age of death at 36.6 years (IQR: 24.7-51.1 years). Most patients survived till adulthood. Survival rate at 20 and 50 years follow-up was 98.6 and 79.5% respectively. Two hundred and twenty nine TSC patients (71.3%) had neurological manifestations, sixteen patients (5.0%) had chronic kidney diseases and five patients (1.6%) had pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Forty seven (16.5%) TSC patients were prescribed with mTOR inhibitors within the study period. Healthcare facility utilization was further analysed in the 2008-2018 cohort. In particular, the mean number of specialist out-patient clinic visits per patient-year was 9.23 per patient-year, which was 4.91 times more than that of local general population.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrevalence of local TSC patients is within the range of that reported in the literature. Local TSC patients have fair long term survival, but they require disproportionally high healthcare cost when compared with the general population, particularly in terms of outpatient (OP) visits. Although effective disease-modifying agent (i.e. mTOR inhibitor) is available, it was not widely used yet in Hong Kong despite the fact that Government approved and supported its use recently. Further research on quality of life and setting up a comprehensive patient registry are necessary for more accurate assessment of cost and benefit.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEverolimus is the hydroxyethyl derivative of sirolimus and a strong inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This drug has immunosuppressive and anticancer activities and the present in vitro study was aimed at identifying the cellular and molecular profiles of breast cancer cells predictive of sensitivity to everolimus.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMCF-7, T-47D, ZR-75-1, CAMA-1, HCC-1500 and MCF-10A cells were used and viability was assessed using WST-1 dye. Sensitivity to everolimus was correlated with phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473/Thr308), mTOR (Ser2448), and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and mutational profile of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 and FRAP genes. Protein phosphorylation was evaluated by AlphaScreen SureFire, while the mutational status was examined by digital droplet PCR and Sanger sequencing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEverolimus showed a transient growth inhibition in non-tumorigenic cells, while in tumorigenic lines the drug suppressed the proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner but with different potency (IC50) and efficacy (Emax), being ZR-75-1 the most sensitive and T47D the least sensitive. MCF-7, T47D and HCC1500 had activating mutations in PIK3CA gene, while loss-of-activity PTEN mutations were detected in sensitive cell lines, including ZR-75-1, which showed no changes or minimal increase in the amount of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) and p-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204) induced by everolimus compared to the resistant cell line T47D in which phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCellular levels of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) and p-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), activating mutations of PIK3CA and inactivating mutations of PTEN may predict response to everolimus in breast cancer cells; these findings have potential applications for treatment personalization of everolimus in breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are well known to play a critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis. However, their role in epileptogenesis has yet to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that elevated mTOR signaling in mouse microglia leads to phenotypic changes, including an amoeboid-like morphology, increased proliferation, and robust phagocytosis activity, but without a significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We further provide evidence that these noninflammatory changes in microglia disrupt homeostasis of the CNS, leading to reduced synapse density, marked microglial infiltration into hippocampal pyramidal layers, moderate neuronal degeneration, and massive proliferation of astrocytes. Moreover, the mice thus affected develop severe early-onset spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). Therefore, we have revealed an epileptogenic mechanism that is independent of the microglial inflammatory response. Our data suggest that microglia could be an opportune target for epilepsy prevention.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis, angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis are a group of diseases characterized by mutation in tuberous sclerosis genes (TSC 1-2). TSC mutation leads to continuous activation of the mTOR pathway that requires adaptation to increased ATP requirement. With limited treatment options, there is an increasing demand to identify novel therapeutic targets and to understand the correlations between mTOR pathway activation and the lack of cell death in the presence of TSC mutation. In the current study, we demonstrate deregulation of p53 controlled and mitochondria associated cell death processes. The study also reveals that treatment of TSC mutant cells with the drug candidate Proxison combined with reduced concentration of rapamycin can increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), can modify miRNA expression pattern associated with p53 regulation and can reduce cell viability.",

    "pages": "1000-8",
    "abstract": "Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a polyphenol natural product of the plant Curcuma longa, is undergoing early clinical trials as a novel anticancer agent. However, the anticancer mechanism of curcumin remains to be elucidated. Recently, we have shown that curcumin inhibits phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), two downstream effector molecules of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in numerous cancer cell lines. This study was designed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We observed that curcumin inhibited mTORC1 signaling not by inhibition of the upstream kinases, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Further, we found that curcumin inhibited mTORC1 signaling independently of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK-tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This is evidenced by the findings that curcumin was able to inhibit phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the cells pretreated with PP2A inhibitor (okadaic acid) or AMPK inhibitor (compound C), or in the cells expressing dominant-negative (dn) PP2A, shRNA to PP2A-A subunit, or dn-AMPKalpha. Curcumin did not alter the TSC1/2 interaction. Knockout of TSC2 did not affect curcumin inhibition of mTOR signaling. Finally, we identified that curcumin was able to dissociate raptor from mTOR, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Therefore, our data indicate that curcumin may represent a new class of mTOR inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "This research assessed the gene expression patterns related to the synthesis of milk in yak, which is characterized by high fat and protein content but low yield. The yak (Bos grunniens) is one of the most crucial domestic animals in Tibetan life; however, the genetic and molecular factors underlying yak milk protein synthesis remain understudied. Yak mammary biopsies harvested during late-pregnancy (d -15) through the end of subsequent lactation (d 1, 15, 30, 60, 180, and 240) were used to evaluate gene expression via real-time quantitative PCR. The expression pattern of 41 genes encompassing multiple pathways integral to milk protein synthesis including insulin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, Jak2-Stat5 signaling, and the expression of glucose and AA transporters was evaluated. Our results confirmed that most upregulated genes increased from d -15 and peaked at d 30 or 60 and then remained relatively highly expressed. Specifically, there was an increased expression of mTOR-related amino acid transporters (SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and SLC36A1), glucose transporters (SLC2A1, SLC2A3, and SLC2A8), Jak2-Stat5 pathway (ELF5), and insulin signaling pathway components (IRS1, PDPK1, and AKT1). For activation of proteins synthesis, MTOR was significantly increased only at d 1. Among inhibitors of mTOR signaling, TSC1 and PRKAA2 were significantly upregulated during lactation. The RPL23 was downregulated among ribosomal components. In conclusion, a critical role for AA and glucose transporters and insulin signaling through mTOR for regulation of yak milk protein synthesis was revealed in this study of the yak mammary gland.",

    "issue": "345(2)",
    "pages": "180-8",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multi-systemic syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene. In TSC2-null cells, Rheb, a member of the Ras family of GTPases, is constitutively activated. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and block the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids with inhibition of Rheb farnesylation and RhoA geranylgeranylation. The effects of rosuvastatin on the function of human TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) α-actin smooth muscle (ASM) cells have been investigated. The TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells, previously isolated in our laboratory from the renal angiomyolipoma of two TSC patients, do not express tuberin and bear loss of heterozigosity caused by a double hit on TSC2 and methylation of TSC2 promoter, respectively. Exposure to rosuvastatin affected TSC2(-/meth) ASM cell growth and promoted tuberin expression by acting as a demethylating agent. This occurred without changes in interleukin release. Rosuvastatin also reduced RhoA activation in TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells, and it required coadministration with the specific mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin to be effective in TSC2(-/-) ASM cells. Rapamycin enhanced rosuvastatin effect in inhibiting cell proliferation in TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells. Rosuvastatin alone did not alter phosphorylation of S6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and at the higher concentration, rosuvastatin and rapamycin slightly decreased ERK phosphorylation. These results suggest that rosuvastatin may potentially represent a treatment adjunct to the therapy with mTOR inhibitors now in clinical development for TSC. In particular, rosuvastatin appears useful when the disease is originated by epigenetic defects.",

    "issue": "16()",
    "pages": "39",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMutations in TSC1 or TSC2 cause the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), while mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). PKD1 lays immediately adjacent to TSC2 and deletions involving both genes, the PKD1/TSC2 contiguous gene syndrome (CGS), are characterized by severe ADPKD, plus TSC. mTOR inhibitors have proven effective in reducing angiomyolipoma (AML) in TSC and total kidney volume in ADPKD but without a positive effect on renal function.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe describe a patient with independent truncating PKD1 and TSC2 mutations who has the expected phenotype for both diseases independently instead of the severe one described in PKD1/TSC2-CGS. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors reduced the AML and kidney volume for 2 years but thereafter they resumed growth; no positive effect on renal function was seen throughout. This is the first case addressing the response to mTOR treatment when independent truncating mutations in PKD1 and TSC2 are present.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis case reveals that although PKD1 and TSC2 are adjacent genes and there is likely cross-talk between the PKD1 and TSC2 signalling pathways regulating mTOR, having independent TSC2 and PKD1 mutations can give rise to a milder kidney phenotype than is typical in PKD1/TSC2-CGS cases. A short-term beneficial effect of mTOR inhibition on AML and total kidney volume was not reflected in improved renal function.",

    "abstract": "Rtp801 (also known as Redd1, and encoded by Ddit4), a stress-related protein triggered by adverse environmental conditions, inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by stabilizing the TSC1-TSC2 inhibitory complex and enhances oxidative stress-dependent cell death. We postulated that Rtp801 acts as a potential amplifying switch in the development of cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, leading to emphysema. Rtp801 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in human emphysematous lungs and in lungs of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. The regulation of Rtp801 expression by cigarette smoke may rely on oxidative stress-dependent activation of the CCAAT response element in its promoter. We also found that Rtp801 was necessary and sufficient for nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in cultured cells and, when forcefully expressed in mouse lungs, it promoted NF-kappaB activation, alveolar inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of alveolar septal cells. In contrast, Rtp801 knockout mice were markedly protected against acute cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, partly via increased mTOR signaling, and, when exposed chronically to cigarette smoke, against emphysema. Our data support the notion that Rtp801 may represent a major molecular sensor and mediator of cigarette smoke-induced lung injury.",

    "abstract": "The metabolism of glucose and glutamine, primary carbon sources utilized by mitochondria to generate energy and macromolecules for cell growth, is directly regulated by mTORC1. We show that glucose and glutamine, by supplying carbons to the TCA cycle to produce ATP, positively feed back to mTORC1 through an AMPK-, TSC1/2-, and Rag-independent mechanism by regulating mTORC1 assembly and its lysosomal localization. We discovered that the ATP-dependent TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex was disassembled and repressed by energy depletion, resulting in its decreased interaction with mTOR. The TTT-RUVBL complex was necessary for the interaction between mTORC1 and Rag and formation of mTORC1 obligate dimers. In cancer tissues, TTT-RUVBL complex mRNAs were elevated and positively correlated with transcripts encoding proteins of anabolic metabolism and mitochondrial function-all mTORC1-regulated processes. Thus, the TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex responds to the cell's metabolic state, directly regulating the functional assembly of mTORC1 and indirectly controlling the nutrient signal from Rags to mTORC1.",

    "pages": "899",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to loss of function of TSC1/TSC2 resulting in increased mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. In the brain, TSC is characterized by the formation of specific lesions that include subependymal and white matter nodules and cortical tubers. Cells that constitute TSC lesions are mainly Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes, but normal cells also populate the tubers. Although considered as a developmental disorder, the histopathological features of brain lesions have been described in only a limited number of fetal cases, providing little information on how these lesions develop. In this report we characterized the development of TSC lesions in 14 fetal brains ranging from 19 gestational weeks (GW) to term and 2 postnatal cases. The study focused on the telencephalon at the level of the caudothalamic notch. Our data indicate that subcortical lesions, forming within and at the vicinity of germinative zones, are the first alterations (already detected in 19GW brains), characterized by the presence of numerous dysmorphic astrocytes and Giant, balloon-like, cells. Our data show that cortical tuber formation is a long process that initiates with the presence of dysmorphic astrocytes (by 19-21GW), progress with the apparition of Giant cells (by 24GW) and mature with the appearance of dysmorphic neurons by the end of gestation (by 36GW). Furthermore, the typical tuberal aspect of cortical lesions is only reached when bundles of neurofilament positive extensions delineate the bottom of the cortical lesion (by 36GW). In addition, our study reveals the presence of Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons immunopositive for interneuron markers such as calbindin and parvalbumin, suggesting that TSC lesions would be mosaic lesions generated from different classes of progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are rare in children. They usually occur in the setting of genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis 1. These tumors have also been reported in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but the incidence is low in comparison with other syndromes. Only 9 cases have been described to date, and it is not yet well understood if any connection exists between TSC and pancreatic endocrine tumors. TSC is characterized by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes, which activate the AKT-mTOR oncogenic cascade. Recent molecular studies in pancreatic endocrine tumors showed activation of the same pathway, which points toward a common molecular pathway between these two entities. We present a case of well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas in a child with TSC and discuss the genetic aspects of this disease.",

    "title": "Glucose deprivation in tuberous sclerosis complex-related tumors.",
    "issue": "1()",
    "pages": "34",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCancer cells possess unique metabolic phenotypes that are determined by their underlying oncogenic pathways. Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade promotes glycolysis and leads to glucose-dependence in tumors. In particular, cells with constitutive mTORC1 activity secondary to the loss of TSC1/TSC2 function are prone to undergo apoptosis upon glucose withdrawal in vitro, but this concept has not been tested in vivo. This study examines the effects of restricting glucose metabolism by pharmacologic and dietary means in a tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor xenograft model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to receive unrestricted carbohydrate-free (\"Carb-free\") or Western-style diet in the absence or presence of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in one of four treatment groups. After 14 weeks, tumor sizes were significantly different among the four treatment groups with those receiving 2-DG having the smallest tumors. Unexpectedly, the \"Carb-free\" diet was associated with the largest tumors but they remained responsive to 2-DG. PET imaging showed significant treatment-related changes in tumor 18fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake but the standard uptake values did not correlate with tumor size. Alternative energy substrates such as ketone bodies and monounsaturated oleic acid supported the growth of the Tsc2-/- cells in vitro, whereas saturated palmitic acid was toxic. Correspondingly, tumors in the high-fat, \"Carb-free\" group showed greater necrosis and liquefaction that contributed to their larger sizes. In contrast, 2-DG treatment significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation, increased metabolic stress (i.e., ketonemia) and AMPK activity, whereas rapamycin primarily reduced cell size.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data support the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a therapeutic approach in TSC whereas dietary withdrawal of carbohydrates was not effective.",

    "issue": "8(1)",
    "pages": "21-31",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare neoplastic disease in which abnormal smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) proliferate in the lungs and along the axial lymphatic systems, including the lymph nodes and thoracic ducts. LAM cells are transformed due to loss-of-function type mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. The pathological features include the proliferation of benign-looking LAM cells and the existence of abundant lymphatic vessels that are associated with clinical conditions such as chyle leakage. LAM cells produce potent lymphangiogenic growth factors (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and the lymphatic vessel density within LAM lesions correlates with the histologic severity of LAM. The serum VEGF-D level increases in LAM, especially in patients with lymphatic involvement. LAM cell clusters (LCCs), which are postulated pathologically to be generated by lymphangiogenesis-mediated fragmentation and subsequent shedding into the lymphatic circulation, are observed in both chylous effusion and LAM-associated lymphatics within LAM tissue specimens. The identification of LCCs in chylous effusion together with the characteristic clinical manifestations can therefore be an alternative for a lung biopsy if LAM patients are complicated with chylous effusion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLAM appears to be a disease involving a dysfunction of the lymphatic system and a fascinating model of tumor dissemination that is exclusively lymphangitic. LAM-associated lymphangiogenesis that mediates the shedding of LCCs seems to play a central role in the dissemination of LAM cells and progression in LAM and it may also be a potential therapeutic target as well as the dysregulated mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is due to pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2 genes resulting in hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway. Many organ systems can be affected, such as brain, skin, eye, heart, bone, kidney, or lung. Typical lesions of TSC usually are those included as major criteria, including angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, tubers, subependymal nodules, angiomyolipomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. However, there are many other manifestations less frequent and/or less well known, many of them not included as clinical diagnostic criteria that are part of the clinical spectrum of TSC. The focus of this review will be on these less common and less well-known manifestations of TSC. Among the rare manifestations, we will discuss some clinical findings including arteriopathy, arachnoid cysts, lymphatic involvement, chordomas, gynecological, endocrine, and gastrointestinal findings. Among the manifestations that are very frequent but much less well known, we find the sclerotic bone lesions. Although they are very frequent in TSC they have been largely overlooked and not considered diagnostic criteria, mainly because they are asymptomatic. However, it is important to know their typical characteristics to avoid misdiagnosing them as metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TS), neurocutaneous disorder resulting from the mutation of 1 of 2 genes, TSC1 or TSC2, is often associated with the formation of hamartomatous lesions in various organ systems, including the skin. TS patients may present with hypomelanic macules, confetti-like spots, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, shagreen patches, forehead plaques, and other dermatological signs. Some of these manifestations are pathognomic for TS and thus should be carefully evaluated when TS diagnosis is suspected. Little is known however on molecular links connecting disease pathogenesis and formation of such hamartomas. In the current review, we describe molecular pathways thought to be responsible for the development of the disease and show how their upregulation may affect the skin. Special attention is paid to protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin, which have recently been found to participate in the control of melanin biosynthesis through microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase transcription.",

    "title": "Chromosomal deletions in bladder cancer: shutting down pathways.",
    "issue": "12()",
    "pages": "826-38",
    "abstract": "Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, leading to approximately 145,000 deaths annually. Bladder cancer is typically managed by surgical removal of the tumor; however, the recurrence rate is disappointingly very high, often requiring systemic chemotherapy. Improvement in the diagnosis and prognosis of bladder cancer will only come from a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that lead to its development. In this review, we focus on the chromosomal deletions that contribute to the downregulation of tumor suppressor pathways in bladder cancer. Chromosomal deletions are not a random event, since bladder cancer progression has been associated with specific chromosomal deletions and this progression correlates with specific stages of tumor development. The most commonly found chromosomal deletion in all stages of bladder cancer involves deletions in chromosome 9, resulting in the loss of three genes encoding proteins that activate the Rb and p53 tumor suppressors. Additionally, chromosome 9 harbors the TSC1 tumor suppressor which downregulates the well-known anti-apoptotic Akt/mTOR pathway. Hence, deletions on one chromosome may have a crucial influence on the initial steps in tumor development. Other deletions targeting the tumor suppressors Rb, p53, FHIT and LZTS1 occur at later stages of tumor development. Considering the central importance of these tumor suppressor pathways in the formation and evolution of tumors, the time has come to evaluate available drugs in bladder cancer that target the positive regulators of these pathways.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder of striking clinical variability. It is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which regulate cell growth and proliferation by inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. TS is characterized by the development of benign tumors in many tissues and organs and its neurological manifestations include epilepsy, autism, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, and giant cell tumors. With mechanism-based mTOR inhibitors therapy now available for many of its manifestations, early diagnosis of TSC is very important in order to offer appropriate care, long-term surveillance and parental counseling. Fetal ultrasound and MRI imaging techniques have evolved and may capture even earlier the following TSC-associated lesions: cardiac rhabdomyomas, subependymal nodules, cortical tubers and renal cysts. Often these represent an incidental finding during a routine ultrasound. Furthermore, in the past decades prenatal molecular diagnosis of TSC has emerged as an important option for families with a known affected member; however, the existing evidence with regards to the clinical characteristics and long-term outcome of babies diagnosed prenatally with TSC is yet limited and the path that follows early TSC detection merits further research.",

    "abstract": "The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes self or foreign antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Engagement of the TCR triggers the formation of multi-molecular signalosomes that lead to the generation of second messengers and subsequent activation of multiple distal signaling cascades, such as the Ca+2-calcineurin-NFAT, RasGRP1-Ras-Erk1/2, PKCθ-IKK-NFκB, and TSC1/2-mTOR pathways. These signaling cascades control many aspects of T cell biology. Mechanisms have been evolved to fine-tune TCR signaling to maintain T cell homeostasis and self-tolerance, and to properly mount effective responses to microbial infection. Defects or deregulation of TCR signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases.",

    "abstract": "A distinct renal tumor has recently been described as \"high-grade oncocytic renal tumor\" and \"sporadic renal cell carcinoma with eosinophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm\". The Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) consensus proposed a unifying name \"eosinophilic vacuolated tumor\" (EVT) for this emerging entity. In this multi-institutional study, we evaluated 19 EVTs, particularly their molecular features and mutation profile, using next-generation sequencing. All cases were sporadic and none of the patients had a tuberous sclerosis complex. There were 8 men and 11 women, with a mean age of 47 years (median 50; range 15-72 years). Average tumor size was 4.3 cm (median 3.8 cm; range 1.5-11.5 cm). All patients with available follow-up data (18/19) were alive and without evidence of disease recurrence or progression during the follow-up, ranging from 12 to 198 months (mean 56.3, median 41.5 months). The tumors were well circumscribed, but lacked a well-formed capsule, had nested to solid growth, focal tubular architecture, and showed ubiquitous, large intracytoplasmic vacuoles, round to oval nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, cathepsin K, CD117, CD10, and antimitochondrial antigen were expressed in all cases. Other positive stains included: PAX8, AE1/AE3 and CK18. CK7 was typically restricted only to rare scattered cells. Vimentin, HMB45, melan-A, and TFE3 were negative in all cases. All tumors showed retained SDHB. All cases (19/19) showed non-overlapping mutations of the mTOR pathway genes: TSC1 (4), TSC2 (7), and MTOR (8); one case with MTOR mutation showed a coexistent RICTOR missense mutation. Low mutational rates were found in all samples (ranged from 0 to 6 mutations/Mbp). Microsatellite instability and copy number variations were not found in any of the 17 analyzable cases. EVT represents an emerging renal entity that shows a characteristic and readily identifiable morphology, consistent immunohistochemical profile, indolent behavior, and mutations in either TSC1, TSC2, or MTOR genes.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth (increase in cell mass or size) is tightly coupled to nutrient availability, growth factors and the energy status of the cell. The target of rapamycin (TOR) integrates all three inputs to control cell growth. The discovery of upstream regulators of TOR (AMPK, the TSC1-TSC2 complex and Rheb) has provided new insights into the mechanism by which TOR integrates its various inputs. A recent finding in flies reveals that TOR controls not only growth of the cell in which it resides (cell-autonomous growth) but also the growth of distant cells, thereby determining organ and organism size in addition to the size of isolated cells. In yeast and mammals, the identification of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein TOR complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) has provided a molecular basis for the complexity of TOR signaling. Furthermore, TOR has emerged as a regulator of growth-related processes such as development, aging and the response to hypoxia. Thus, TOR is part of an intra- and inter-cellular signaling network with a remarkably broad role in eukaryotic biology.",

    "abstract": "Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are a pathological hallmark of more than 20 distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia. While the exact mechanism of tau aggregation is unknown, the accumulation of aggregates correlates with disease progression. Here we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify modulators of endogenous tau protein for the first time. Primary screens performed in SH-SY5Y cells, identified positive and negative regulators of tau protein levels. Hit validation of the top 43 candidate genes was performed using Ngn2-induced human cortical excitatory neurons. Using this approach, genes and pathways involved in modulation of endogenous tau levels were identified, including chromatin modifying enzymes, neddylation and ubiquitin pathway members, and components of the mTOR pathway. TSC1, a critical component of the mTOR pathway, was further validated in vivo, demonstrating the relevance of this screening strategy. These findings may have implications for treating neurodegenerative diseases in the future.",

    "title": "Review of the treatment options for epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex: towards precision medicine.",
    "issue": "14()",
    "pages": "17562864211031100",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode proteins that antagonise the mammalian isoform of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) - a key mediator of cell growth and metabolism. TSC is characterised by the development of benign tumours in multiple organs, together with neurological manifestations including epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). Epilepsy occurs frequently and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; however, the management is challenging due to the intractable nature of the seizures. Preventative epilepsy treatment is a key aim, especially as patients with epilepsy may be at a higher risk of developing severe cognitive and behavioural impairment. Vigabatrin given preventatively reduces the risk and severity of epilepsy although the benefits for TAND are inconclusive. These promising results could pave the way for evaluating other treatments in a preventative capacity, especially those that may address the underlying pathophysiology of TSC, including everolimus, cannabidiol and the ketogenic diet (KD). Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor approved for the adjunctive treatment of refractory TSC-associated seizures that has demonstrated significant reductions in seizure frequency compared with placebo, improvements that were sustained after 2 years of treatment. Highly purified cannabidiol, recently approved in the US as Epidiolex® for TSC-associated seizures in patients ⩾1 years of age, and the KD, may also participate in the regulation of the mTOR pathway. This review focusses on the pivotal clinical evidence surrounding these potential targeted therapies that may form the foundation of precision medicine for TSC-associated epilepsy, as well as other current treatments including anti-seizure drugs, vagus nerve stimulation and surgery. New future therapies are also discussed, together with the potential for preventative treatment with targeted therapies. Due to advances in understanding the molecular genetics and pathophysiology, TSC represents a prototypic clinical syndrome for studying epileptogenesis and the impact of precision medicine.",

Based on clinical observations, data from accessible GWAS and expression datasets we identified ASDs gene candidates. Integrative gene network and a novel CNV-centric Node Network (CNN) analysis method highlighted ASDs-associated key elements and biological processes. Functional analysis identified neurological functions including synaptic cholinergic receptor (CHRNA) families, dopamine receptor (DRD2), and correlations between social behavior and oxytocin related pathways. CNN analysis of genome-wide genetic and expression data identified inheritance-related clusters related to PTEN/TSC1/FMR1 and mTor/PI3K regulation. Integrative analysis identified potential regulators of networks, specifically TNF and beta-estradiol, suggesting a potential central role in ASDs. Our data provide information on potential disease mechanisms, and key regulators that may generate novel postulations, and diagnostic molecular biomarkers.",

    "issue": "12(3)",
    "pages": "263-73",
    "abstract": "Deciding to exit pluripotency and undergo differentiation is of singular importance for pluripotent cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The molecular mechanisms for these decisions to differentiate, as well as reversing those decisions during induced pluripotency (iPS), have focused largely on transcriptomic controls. Here, we explore the role of translational control for the maintenance of pluripotency and the decisions to differentiate. Global protein translation is significantly reduced in hESCs compared to their differentiated progeny. Furthermore, p70 S6K activation is restricted in hESCs compared to differentiated fibroblast-like cells. Disruption of p70 S6K-mediated translation by rapamycin or siRNA knockdown in undifferentiated hESCs does not alter cell viability or expression of the pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog. However, expression of constitutively active p70 S6K, but not wild-type p70 S6K, induces differentiation. Additionally, hESCs exhibit high levels of the mTORC1/p70 S6K inhibitory complex TSC1/TSC2 and preferentially express more rapamycin insensitive mTORC2 compared to differentiated cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of both TSC2 and Rictor elevates p70 S6K activation and induces differentiation of hESCs. These results suggest that hESCs tightly regulate mTORC1/p70 S6K-mediated protein translation to maintain a pluripotent state as well as implicate a novel role for protein synthesis as a driving force behind hESC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays pivotal roles in cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis by maintaining somatic stem cell functions. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling functions as an integrative rheostat that orchestrates various cellular and metabolic activities that shape tissue homeostasis. Whether these two fundamental signaling pathways couple to exert physiological functions still remains mysterious. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discover that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling suppresses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Deficiency in tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), core negative regulators of mTORC1 activity, represses Wnt/β-catenin target gene expression, which can be rescued by RAD001. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling regulates the cell surface level of Wnt receptor Frizzled (FZD) in a Dishevelled (DVL)-dependent manner by influencing the association of DVL and clathrin AP-2 adaptor. Sustained mTORC1 activation impairs Wnt/β-catenin signaling and causes loss of stemness in intestinal organoids ex vivo and primitive intestinal progenitors in vivo. Wnt/β-catenin-dependent liver metabolic zonation gene expression program is also down-regulated by mTORC1 activation. Our study provides a paradigm that mTORC1 signaling cell autonomously regulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway to influence stem cell maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem genetic disorder affecting almost all organs with no sex predominance. TSC has an autosomal-dominant inheritance and is caused by a heterozygous mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene leading to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). TSC is associated with several pulmonary manifestations including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) and chylous effusions. LAM is a multisystem disorder characterised by cystic destruction of lung parenchyma, and may occur in either the setting of TSC (TSC-LAM) or sporadically (S-LAM). LAM occurs in 30-40% of adult females with TSC at childbearing age and is considered a nonmalignant metastatic neoplasm of unknown origin. TSC-LAM is generally milder and, unlike S-LAM, may occur in males. It manifests as multiple, bilateral, diffuse and thin-walled cysts with normal intervening lung parenchyma on chest computed tomography. LAM is complicated by spontaneous pneumothoraces in up to 70% of patients, with a high recurrence rate. mTOR inhibitors are the treatment of choice for LAM with moderately impaired lung function or chylous effusion. MMPH, manifesting as multiple solid and ground-glass nodules on high-resolution computed tomography, is usually harmless with no need for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancers are extremely aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. In particular, effective treatment strategies are limited for patients diagnosed with triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which also carries the worst prognosis of all forms of breast cancer; therefore, extensive studies have focused on the identification of molecularly targeted therapies for this tumor subtype. Here, we sought to identify molecular targets that are capable of suppressing tumorigenesis in TNBCs. Specifically, we found that death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is essential for growth of p53-mutant cancers, which account for over 80% of TNBCs. Depletion or inhibition of DAPK1 suppressed growth of p53-mutant but not p53-WT breast cancer cells. Moreover, DAPK1 inhibition limited growth of other p53-mutant cancers, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers. DAPK1 mediated the disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, resulting in activation of the mTOR pathway. Our studies demonstrated that high DAPK1 expression causes increased cancer cell growth and enhanced signaling through the mTOR/S6K pathway; evaluation of multiple breast cancer patient data sets revealed that high DAPK1 expression associates with worse outcomes in individuals with p53-mutant cancers. Together, our data support targeting DAPK1 as a potential therapeutic strategy for p53-mutant cancers.",

The phosphorylation of the mRNA-binding protein FMRP reportedly depends on mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity via p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). Because this phosphorylation is thought to regulate the translation of messages important for synaptic plasticity, we explored whether FMRP phosphorylation of the S6K1-dependent residue (S499) is altered in TSC and states of dysregulated TSC-mTORC1 signaling. Surprisingly, we found that FMRP S499 phosphorylation was unchanged in heterozygous and conditional Tsc1 knockout mice despite significantly elevated mTORC1-S6K1 activity. Neither up- nor down-regulation of the mTORC1-S6K1 axis in vivo or in vitro had any effect on phospho-FMRP S499 levels. In addition, FMRP S499 phosphorylation was unaltered in S6K1-knockout mice. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that FMRP S499 phosphorylation is independent of mTORC1-S6K1 activity and is not altered in TSC.",

    "abstract": "Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a tumor-suppressor gene disorder characterized by skin tumors, cystic lung disease and renal cell carcinoma. Very little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of BHD. Clinical similarities between BHD and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) suggest that the BHD and TSC proteins may function within a common pathway. The TSC proteins inhibit the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Bhd and Tsc1/Tsc2 have opposing roles in the regulation of amino-acid homeostasis. We report here that in mammalian cells, downregulation of BHD reduces the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, an indicator of TORC1 activity. To determine whether folliculin, the product of the BHD gene, regulates mammalian target of rapamycin activity in vivo, we generated a mouse with targeted inactivation of the Bhd gene. The mice developed spontaneous oncocytic cysts and tumors composed of cells that resemble the renal cell carcinomas in BHD patients. The cysts and tumors had low levels of phospho-S6. Taken together, these data indicate that folliculin regulates the activity of TORC1, and suggest a new paradigm in which both inappropriately high and inappropriately low levels of TORC1 activity can be associated with renal tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWe investigated the effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway on CD8+ T cell immunity through Eomesodermin (Eomes) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with invasive candidiasis (IC) and in a mouse model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated quantitative changes in parameters of the mTOR/phosphorylated ribosomal S6 kinase (pS6K) pathway and immune system at the onset of infection in ICU patients. The study was registered on 28 February 2017 at chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR-ROC-17010750). We also used a mouse model of Candida infection and constructed T-cell-specific mTOR and T-cell-specific tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 conditional knockout mice to elucidate the molecular mechanisms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 88 patients, including 8 with IC. The IC group had lower CD8+ T cell counts, higher serum levels of mTOR, pS6K, Eomes and interleukin (IL)-6. The mouse model with IC showed results consistent in the clinical study. The CD8+ T cell immune response to IC seemed to be weakened in TSC1 knockout mice compared with wild-type IC mice, demonstrating that mTOR activation resulted in the impaired CD8+ T cell immunity in IC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn IC, the mTOR activation may play a vital role in impaired CD8+ T cell immunity through enhancing expression of Eomes. The study was registered on 28 February 2017 at chictr.org.cn (identifier ChiCTR-ROC-17010750).",

    "abstract": "Treatment of muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma (BCa) remains a major challenge. Comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors and identification of driver mutations may reveal new therapeutic targets. This manuscript discusses relevant molecular drivers of the malignant phenotype and agents with therapeutic potential in BCa. Small molecule pan-FGFR inhibitors have shown encouraging efficacy and safety results especially among patients with activating FGFR mutations or translocations. mTOR inhibitors for patients with TSC1 mutations and concomitant targeting of PI3K and MEK represent strategies to block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Encouraging preclinical results with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) exemplifies a new potential treatment for HER2-positive BCa along with innovative bispecific antibodies. Inhibitors of cell cycle regulators (aurora kinase, polo-like kinase 1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4) are being investigated in combination with chemotherapy. Early results of clinical studies with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PDL1 are propelling immune modulating drugs to the forefront of emerging treatments for BCa. Collectively, these novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies hold promise to improve the outcome of patients afflicted with this malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Naive T cells receive stimulation from the positive selecting ligand in the periphery for their survival. This stimulation does not normally lead to overt activation of T cells, as the T cells remain largely quiescent until they receive either antigenic or lymphopenic stimuli. The underlying mechanism responsible for survival and quiescence of the naive T cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that T cell-specific deletion of Tsc1, a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin, resulted in both spontaneous losses of quiescence and cellularity, especially within the CD8 subset. The Tsc1-deficient T cells have increased cell proliferation and apoptosis. Tsc1 deletion affects the survival and quiescence of T cells in the absence of antigenic stimulation. Loss of quiescence but not cellularity was inhibited by rapamycin. Our data demonstrate that tuberous sclerosis complex-mammalian target of rapamycin maintains quiescence and survival of T cells.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE\nJinlida granule (JLDG), composed of seventeen Chinese medical herbs, is a widely used Chinese herbal prescription for treating diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. To determine the main components in JLDG and to explore the effect of JLDG on autophagy and lipid accumulation in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells exposed to politic acid (PA) through AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nJLDG was prepared and the main components contained in the granules were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) fingerprint. Intracellular lipid accumulation in NIT-1 cells was induced by culturing with medium containing PA. Intracellular lipid droplets were observed by Oil Red O staining and triglyceride (TG) content was measured by colorimetric assay. The formation of autophagosomes was observed under transmission electron microscope. The expression of AMPK and phospho-AMPK (pAMPK) proteins as well as its downstream fatty acid metabolism-related proteins (fatty acid synthase, FAS; acetyl-coA carboxylase, ACC; carnitine acyltransferase 1, CPT-1) and autophagy-related genes (mammal target of rapamycin, mTOR; tuberous sclerosis complex 1, TSC1; microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, LC3-II) were determined by Western blot. The expression of sterol regulating element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA was examined by real time PCR (RT-PCR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur data showed that JLDG could significantly reduce PA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells. This effect was associated with increased protein expression of pAMPK and AMPK in NIT-1 cells. Treatment with JLDG also decreased the expression of AMPK downstream lipogenic genes (SREBP-1c mRNA, FAS and ACC proteins) whereas increased the expression of fatty acid oxidation gene (CPT-1 protein). Additionally, JLDG-treated cells displayed a markedly increase in the number of autophagosomes which was accompanied by the down-regulation of mTOR and the up-regulation of TSC1 and LC3-II proteins expression. However, when AMPK phosphorylation was inhibited by Compound C, JLDG supplementation did not exhibit any effect on the expression of these AMPK downstream molecules in NIT-1 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that JLDG could reduce intracellular lipid accumulation and enhance the autophagy in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells cultured with PA. The mechanism is possibly mediated by AMPK activation.",

    "pages": "97",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMalignant angiomyolipoma is an uncommon tumor of the class of perivasciular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas). These tumors are characteristically driven by deleterious mutations in the tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2, whose gene products typically act to inhibit mTOR. There are several cases of malignant angiomyolipoma which exhibit transient responses to mTOR inhibitors, forming the basis of current practice guidelines in malignant PEComa. However the tumors ultimately acquire resistance, and there is no well-established second-line option. Despite the increasing prevalence of immunotherapy across a wide range of solid tumors, little is known about the immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression of angiomyolipoma. Furthermore, there is no reported case on the treatment of malignant angiomyolipoma with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nA 38 year-old man presented with gross hematuria and was diagnosed with renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma. Despite surgical resection, the tumor recurred and metastasized. Targeted genomic sequencing revealed a deleterious mutation in TSC2, and the patient was treated with the mTOR inihbitor everolimus. The patient went on to have a partial response but ultimately progressed. He was then treated with the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, and achieved a durable near-complete response which is ongoing after two years of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue revealed strong PD-L1 expression and a brisk T-cell infiltrate.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe report on the first durable systemic treatment of malignant epithelioid angiomyolipoima with the use of PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Given the absence of prospective clinical trials in this exceedingly rare disease, particularly in the second-line setting, immune checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Several stress conditions are characterized by activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the development of leucine resistance in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we determined whether direct activation of the AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR) prevents the characteristic leucine-induced increase in protein synthesis by altering mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction. Rats were injected with AICAR or saline (Sal) and 1 h thereafter received an oral gavage of leucine (or Sal). Efficacy of AICAR was verified by increased AMPK phosphorylation. AICAR decreased basal in vivo muscle (gastrocnemius) protein synthesis and completely prevented the leucine-induced increase, independent of a change in muscle adenine nucleotide concentration. AICAR also prevented the hyperphosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E binding protein (4E-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), S6, and eIF4G in response to leucine, suggesting a decrease in mTOR activity. Moreover, AICAR prevented the leucine-induced redistribution of eIF4E from the inactive eIF4E.4E-BP1 to the active eIF4E.eIF4G complex. This ability of AICAR to produce muscle leucine resistance could not be attributed to a change in phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2, the formation of a TSC1.TSC2 complex, the binding of raptor with mTOR, or the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2. However, the inhibitory actions of AICAR were associated with reduced phosphorylation of proline-rich Akt substrate-40 and increased phosphorylation of raptor, which represent potential mechanisms by which AICAR might be expected to inhibit leucine-induced increases in mTOR activity and protein synthesis under in vivo conditions.",

    "abstract": "Through unknown mechanisms, insulin activates the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c) transcription factor to promote hepatic lipogenesis. We find that this induction is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). To further define the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of SREBP1c in the liver, we generated mice with liver-specific deletion of TSC1 (LTsc1KO), which results in insulin-independent activation of mTORC1. Surprisingly, the LTsc1KO mice are protected from age- and diet-induced hepatic steatosis and display hepatocyte-intrinsic defects in SREBP1c activation and de novo lipogenesis. These phenotypes result from attenuation of Akt signaling driven by mTORC1-dependent insulin resistance. Therefore, mTORC1 activation is not sufficient to stimulate hepatic SREBP1c in the absence of Akt signaling, revealing the existence of an additional downstream pathway also required for this induction. We provide evidence that this mTORC1-independent pathway involves Akt-mediated suppression of Insig2a, a liver-specific transcript encoding the SREBP1c inhibitor INSIG2.",

    "abstract": "Mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) constitutively activates mTORC1, increases cell proliferation, and induces the pathological manifestations observed in tuberous sclerosis (TS) and in pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). While the role of mTORC1 in TSC2-dependent growth has been extensively characterized, little is known about the role of mTORC2. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 modulates TSC2-null cell proliferation and survival through RhoA GTPase and Bcl2 proteins. TSC2-null cell proliferation was inhibited not only by reexpression of TSC2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced downregulation of Rheb, mTOR, or raptor, but also by siRNA for rictor. Increased RhoA GTPase activity and P-Ser473 Akt were inhibited by siRNA for rictor. Importantly, constitutively active V14RhoA reversed growth inhibition induced by siRNA for rictor, siRNA TSC1, reexpression of TSC2, or simvastatin. While siRNA for RhoA had a modest effect on growth inhibition, downregulation of RhoA markedly increased TSC2-null cell apoptosis. Inhibition of RhoA activity downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl2 and upregulated proapoptotic Bim, Bok, and Puma. In vitro and in vivo, simvastatin alone or in combination with rapamycin inhibited cell growth and induced TSC2-null cell apoptosis, abrogated TSC2-null tumor growth, improved animal survival, and prevented tumor recurrence by inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2-dependent activation of RhoA is required for TSC2-null cell growth and survival and suggest that targeting both mTORC2 and mTORC1 by a combination of proapoptotic simvastatin and cytostatic rapamycin shows promise for combinational therapeutic intervention in diseases with TSC2 dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The cellular origins of glomerulosclerosis involve activation of parietal epithelial cells (PECs) and progressive podocyte depletion. While mammalian target of rapamycin-mediated (mTOR-mediated) podocyte hypertrophy is recognized as an important signaling pathway in the context of glomerular disease, the role of podocyte hypertrophy as a compensatory mechanism preventing PEC activation and glomerulosclerosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that glomerular mTOR and PEC activation-related genes were both upregulated and intercorrelated in biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy, suggesting both compensatory and pathological roles. Advanced morphometric analyses in murine and human tissues identified podocyte hypertrophy as a compensatory mechanism aiming to regulate glomerular functional integrity in response to somatic growth, podocyte depletion, and even glomerulosclerosis - all of this in the absence of detectable podocyte regeneration. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling during acute podocyte loss impaired hypertrophy of remaining podocytes, resulting in unexpected albuminuria, PEC activation, and glomerulosclerosis. Exacerbated and persistent podocyte hypertrophy enabled a vicious cycle of podocyte loss and PEC activation, suggesting a limit to its beneficial effects. In summary, our data highlight a critical protective role of mTOR-mediated podocyte hypertrophy following podocyte loss in order to preserve glomerular integrity, preventing PEC activation and glomerulosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic landscape of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has greatly expanded in the last decade. From being a malignancy orphan of effective therapies, kidney cancer has become today a tumor with several treatment options. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a metabolic disease, being characterized by the dysregulation of metabolic pathways involved in oxygen sensing (VHL/HIF pathway alterations and the subsequent up-regulation of HIF-responsive genes such as VEGF, PDGF, EGF, and glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, which justify the RCC reliance on aerobic glycolysis), energy sensing (fumarate hydratase-deficient, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC, mutations of HGF/MET pathway resulting in the metabolic Warburg shift marked by RCC increased dependence on aerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate shunt, augmented lipogenesis, and reduced AMPK and Krebs cycle activity) and/or nutrient sensing cascade (deregulation of AMPK-TSC1/2-mTOR and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways). In this complex scenario it is important to find prognostic and predictive factors that can help in decision making in the treatment of mRCC.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) represent a minority of pancreatic neoplasms that exhibit variability in prognosis. Ongoing mutational analyses of PanNENs have found recurrent abnormalities in chromatin remodeling genes (e.g., DAXX and ATRX), and mTOR pathway genes (e.g., TSC2, PTEN PIK3CA, and MEN1), some of which have relevance to patients with related familial syndromes. Most recently, grade 3 PanNENs have been divided into two groups based on differentiation, creating a new group of well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) that have had a limited whole-genome level characterization to date. In a patient with a metastatic well-differentiated grade 3 PanNET, our study utilized whole-genome sequencing of liver metastases for the comparative analysis and detection of single-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, structural variants, and copy-number variants, with their biologic relevance confirmed by RNA sequencing. We found that this tumor most notably exhibited a TSC1-disrupting fusion, showed a novel CHD7-BEND2 fusion, and lacked any somatic variants in ATRX, DAXX, and MEN1.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2 and is characterized by the presence of hamartomas in many organs. Although tuberous sclerosis complex is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome with classic \"second hits\" detectable in renal tumors, conventional genetic analysis has not revealed somatic inactivation of the second allele in the majority of human brain lesions. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of post-translational inactivation of the TSC2 protein, tuberin, by physiologically inappropriate phosphorylation, which is specific to tuberous sclerosis complex-associated brain lesions. Additional analysis shows that tissue specificity is due to abnormal activation of the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in brain but not in renal tumors. These results have widespread implications for understanding the tissue specificity of tumor suppressor gene phenotypes.",

    "title": "Heterozygous inactivation of tsc2 enhances tumorigenesis in p53 mutant zebrafish.",
    "issue": "6(4)",
    "pages": "925-33",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multi-organ disorder caused by mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. A key function of these genes is to inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) kinase signaling. Cells deficient for TSC1 or TSC2 have increased mTORC1 signaling and give rise to benign tumors, although, as a rule, true malignancies are rarely seen. In contrast, other disorders with increased mTOR signaling typically have overt malignancies. A better understanding of genetic mechanisms that govern the transformation of benign cells to malignant ones is crucial to understand cancer pathogenesis. We generated a zebrafish model of TSC and cancer progression by placing a heterozygous mutation of the tsc2 gene in a p53 mutant background. Unlike tsc2 heterozygous mutant zebrafish, which never exhibited cancers, compound tsc2;p53 mutants had malignant tumors in multiple organs. Tumorigenesis was enhanced compared with p53 mutant zebrafish. p53 mutants also had increased mTORC1 signaling that was further enhanced in tsc2;p53 compound mutants. We found increased expression of Hif1-α, Hif2-α and Vegf-c in tsc2;p53 compound mutant zebrafish compared with p53 mutant zebrafish. Expression of these proteins probably underlies the increased angiogenesis seen in compound mutant zebrafish compared with p53 mutants and might further drive cancer progression. Treatment of p53 and compound mutant zebrafish with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin caused rapid shrinkage of tumor size and decreased caliber of tumor-associated blood vessels. This is the first report using an animal model to show interactions between tsc2, mTORC1 and p53 during tumorigenesis. These results might explain why individuals with TSC rarely have malignant tumors, but also suggest that cancer arising in individuals without TSC might be influenced by the status of TSC1 and/or TSC2 mutations and be potentially treatable with mTORC1 inhibitors.",

    "title": "Efficacy and safety of Everolimus in children with TSC - associated epilepsy - Pilot data from an open single-center prospective study.",
    "issue": "11(1)",
    "pages": "145",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEpilepsy occurs in up to 90 % of all individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In 67 % disease onset is during childhood. In ≥ 50 % seizures are refractory to currently available treatment options. The mTOR-Inhibitor Everolimus (Votubia®) was approved for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and renal angiomyolipoma (AML) in Europe in 2011. It's anticonvulsive/antiepileptic properties are promising, but evidence is still limited. Study aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Everolimus in children and adolescents with TSC-associated epilepsies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nInclusion-criteria of this investigator-initiated, single-center, open, prospective study were: 1) the ascertained diagnosis of TSC; 2) age ≤ 18 years; 3) treatment indication for Votubia® according to the European Commission guidelines; 4) drug-resistant TSC-associated epilepsy, 5) prospective continuous follow-up for at least 6 months after treatment initiation and 6) informed consent to participate. Votubia® was orally administered once/day, starting with 4.5 mg/m2 and titrated to achieve blood trough concentrations between 5 and 15 ng/ml. Primary endpoint was the reduction in seizure frequency of ≥ 50 % compared to baseline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen patients (nine male) with a median age of six (range; 1-18) years fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 26 % (4/15) had TSC1, 66 % (10/15) had TSC2 mutations. In one patient no mutation was found. Time of observation after treatment initiation was median 22 (range; 6-50) months. At last observation, 80 % (12/15) of the patients were responders, 58 % of them (7/12) were seizure free. The overall reduction in seizure frequency was 60 % in focal seizures, 80 % in generalized tonic clonic seizures and 87 % in drop attacks. The effect of Everolimus was seen already at low doses, early after treatment initiation. Loss of efficacy over time was not observed. Transient side effects were seen in 93 % (14/15) of the patients. In no case the drug had to be withdrawn.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEverolimus seems to be an effective treatment option not only for SEGA and AML, but also for TSC-related epilepsies. Although there are potential serious side effects, treatment was tolerated well by the majority of patients, provided that patients are under close surveillance of epileptologists who are familiar with immunosuppressive agents.",

    "abstract": "mTOR senses nutrient and energy status to regulate cell survival and metabolism in response to environmental changes. Surprisingly, targeted mutation of Tsc1, a negative regulator of mTORC1, caused a broad reduction in miRNAs due to Drosha degradation. Conversely, targeted mutation of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, increased miRNA biogenesis. mTOR activation increased expression of Mdm2, which is hereby identified as the necessary and sufficient ubiquitin E3 ligase for Drosha. Drosha was induced by nutrient and energy deprivation and conferred resistance to glucose deprivation. Using a high-throughput screen of a miRNA library, we identified four miRNAs that were necessary and sufficient to protect cells against glucose-deprivation-induced apoptosis. These miRNA was regulated by glucose through the mTORC1-MDM2-DROSHA axis. Taken together, our data reveal an mTOR-Mdm2-Drosha pathway in mammalian cells that broadly regulates miRNA biogenesis as a response to alteration in cellular environment.",

    "pages": "250",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a monogenetic, multisystem disorder characterized by benign growths due to TSC1 or TSC2 mutations. This German multicenter study estimated the costs and related cost drivers associated with organ manifestations in adults with TSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA validated, three-month, retrospective questionnaire assessed the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, organ manifestations, direct, indirect, out-of-pocket (OOP), and nursing care-level costs among adult individuals with TSC throughout Germany from a societal perspective (costing year: 2019).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 192 adults with TSC (mean age: 33.4 ± 12.7 years; range: 18-78 years, 51.6% [n = 99] women). Reported TSC disease manifestations included skin (94.8%) and kidney and urinary tract (74%) disorders, epilepsy (72.9%), structural brain defects (67.2%), psychiatric disorders (50.5%), heart and circulatory system disorders (50.5%), and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (11.5%). TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were reported in 16.7% and 25% of respondents, respectively. Mean direct health care costs totaled EUR 6452 (median EUR 1920; 95% confidence interval [CI] EUR 5533-7422) per patient over three months. Medication costs represented the major direct cost category (77% of total direct costs; mean EUR 4953), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors represented the largest share (68%, EUR 4358). Mean antiseizure drug (ASD) costs were only EUR 415 (6%). Inpatient costs (8%, EUR 518) and outpatient treatment costs (7%; EUR 467) were important further direct cost components. The mean care grade allowance as an approximator of informal nursing care costs was EUR 929 (median EUR 0; 95% CI EUR 780-1083) over three months. Mean indirect costs totaled EUR 3174 (median EUR 0; 95% CI EUR 2503-3840) among working-age individuals (< 67 years in Germany). Multiple regression analyses revealed mTOR inhibitor use and persistent seizures as independent cost-driving factors for total direct costs. Older age and disability were independent cost-driving factors for total indirect costs, whereas epilepsy, psychiatric disease, and disability were independent cost-driving factors for nursing care costs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis three-month study revealed substantial direct healthcare, indirect healthcare, and medication costs associated with TSC in Germany. This study highlights the spectrum of organ manifestations and their associated treatment needs in the German healthcare setting.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nDRKS, DRKS00016045.

    "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is a novel, amyloid-independent tauopathy associated with elevated phosphorylated 3R/4R tau aggregation.",
    "issue": "10(1)",
    "pages": "27",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes and autosomal dominantly inherited. These mutations cause hyperactivation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to the development of nonmalignant masses involving various organ systems. Patients with TSC also experience neuropsychiatric symptoms collectively termed Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorder (TAND). Due to research advancements in TSC, patients now live well beyond the age of 50. Many experience objective impairment of memory and executive function, supported by formal neuropsychological testing, beginning in their late 40s. Biomarker analysis has described elevated levels of phosphorylated tau-181 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with TAND. Tau-PET imaging has also shown focal accumulation of the radiotracer flortaucipir (AV1451), suggesting that TSC may be a neurodegenerative disorder arising from accumulation of phosphorylated tau. However, the flortaucipir tracer has been reported to have significant off-target binding, preventing definitive conclusions from being drawn about the molecular etiology of neurodegeneration in TSC. Therefore, we initiated the Colocalization of AV1451 and Phosphorylated Tau in Adult brain tissue (CAPA) study. This study aimed to determine if flortaucipir is bound to phosphorylated tau in brains of patients with TSC and further sought to determine the specific tau isoform seen in TSC. Our results show that flortaucipir labels the 3R/4R isoform of phosphorylated tau, commonly seen in Alzheimer's disease. However, amyloid staining was negative in brains of adult patients with TSC. Therefore, we conclude that TAND symptoms are due to the accumulation of the phosphorylated tau isoform seen in Alzheimer's disease. This study suggests that hyperactivation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathway may play a role in the amyloid-independent development of 3R/4R tau aggregation. Our findings could lead to a new era of anti-tau therapies used to treat both disorders.",

    "issue": "153(2)",
    "pages": "339-348",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease of women caused by proliferation of neoplastic-like LAM cells, with mutations in the TSC1/2 tumor suppressor genes. Based on case reports, levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), an ovarian cancer biomarker, can be elevated in patients with LAM. We hypothesized that elevated serum CA-125 levels seen in some patients with LAM were due to LAM, not other malignancies, and might respond to sirolimus treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSerum CA-125 levels were measured for 241 patients at each visit. Medical records were reviewed for co-morbidities, disease progression, and response to sirolimus treatment. CA-125 expression in LAM cells was determined by using immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlmost 25% of patients with LAM had at least one elevated serum CA-125 measurement. Higher serum CA-125 levels correlated with lower FEV1, premenopausal status, and pleural effusion in a multivariate model (each P < .001). Serum CA-125 levels decreased following sirolimus treatment (P = .002). CA-125 and α-smooth muscle actin were co-expressed in LAM lung nodules.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher serum CA-125 levels were associated with pleural effusions and reduced pulmonary function and were decreased with sirolimus therapy. LAM cells express CA-125. Some elevated serum CA-125 levels may reflect serosal membrane involvement.",

    "pages": "1058-76",
    "abstract": "Amino acids regulate TOR complex 1 (TORC1) via two counteracting mechanisms, one activating and one inactivating. The presence of amino acids causes TORC1 recruitment to lysosomes where TORC1 is activated by binding Rheb. How the absence of amino acids inactivates TORC1 is less well understood. Amino acid starvation recruits the TSC1/TSC2 complex to the vicinity of TORC1 to inhibit Rheb; however, the upstream mechanisms regulating TSC2 are not known. We identify here the eIF4A-containing eIF4F translation initiation complex as an upstream regulator of TSC2 in response to amino acid withdrawal in Drosophila We find that TORC1 and translation preinitiation complexes bind each other. Cells lacking eIF4F components retain elevated TORC1 activity upon amino acid removal. This effect is specific for eIF4F and not a general consequence of blocked translation. This study identifies specific components of the translation machinery as important mediators of TORC1 inactivation upon amino acid removal.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma of clear-cell type (ccRCC) is an enigmatic tumor type, characterized by frequent inactivation of the VHL gene (infrequently mutated in other tumor types), responsiveness to angiogenesis inhibitors, and resistance to both chemotherapy and conventional radiation therapy. ccRCC tumors exhibit substantial mutation heterogeneity. Recent studies using massively parallel sequencing technologies have implicated several novel driver genes. In VHL wild-type tumors, mutations were discovered in TCEB1, which encodes Elongin C, a protein that binds to VHL and is required for its function. Several additional tumor suppressor genes have been identified near the VHL gene, within a region that is frequently deleted in ccRCC on chromosome 3p: SETD2, BAP1, and PBRM1. Mutations in BAP1 and PBRM1 are largely mutually exclusive and are associated with different tumor biology and patient outcomes. In addition, the mTORC1 pathway is deregulated by mutations in MTOR, TSC1, PIK3CA, and PTEN in approximately 20% of ccRCCs. Mutations in TSC1, and possibly other genes, may predict for sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitors. These discoveries provide insight into ccRCC development and set the foundation for the first molecular genetic classification of the disease, paving the way for subtype-specific therapies.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a critical signal transduction pathway that regulates multiple cellular functions. Aberrant activation of this pathway has been identified in a wide range of cancers. Several pathway components including AKT, PI3K and mTOR represent potential therapeutic targets and many small molecule inhibitors are in development or early clinical trials. The complex regulation of the pathway, together with the multiple mechanisms by which it can be activated, make this a highly challenging pathway to target. For successful inhibition, detailed molecular information on individual tumours will be required and it is already clear that different tumour types show distinct combinations of alterations. Recent results have identified alterations in pathway components PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1 and TSC1 in bladder cancer, some of which are significantly related to tumour phenotype and clinical behaviour. Co-existence of alterations to several PI3K pathway genes in some bladder tumours indicates that these proteins may have functions that are not related solely to the known canonical pathway.",

    "title": "Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies synergy between mTOR pathway inhibition and chloroquine in bladder cancer cells.",
    "issue": "35(34)",
    "pages": "4518-28",
    "abstract": "Mutations to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) signalling pathway components (for example, PTEN loss, PIK3CA, AKT1, TSC1/2) are common in bladder cancer, yet small-molecule inhibitors of these nodes (FGFR/PTENi) show only modest activity in preclinical models. As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)-an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "Loss of tuberin, the product of TSC2 gene, increases mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, promoting cell growth and tumor development. However, in cells expressing tuberin, it is not known how repression of mTOR signaling is relieved to activate this pathway in response to growth factors and how hamartin participates in this process. We show that hamartin colocalizes with hypophosphorylated tuberin at the membrane, where tuberin exerts its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity to repress Rheb signaling. In response to growth signals, tuberin is phosphorylated by AKT and translocates to the cytosol, relieving Rheb repression. Phosphorylation of tuberin at serines 939 and 981 does not alter its intrinsic GAP activity toward Rheb but partitions tuberin to the cytosol, where it is bound by 14-3-3 proteins. Thus, tuberin bound by 14-3-3 in response to AKT phosphorylation is sequestered away from its membrane-bound activation partner (hamartin) and its target GTPase (Rheb) to relieve the growth inhibitory effects of this tumor suppressor.",

    "pages": "952-963",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nArticular chondrocyte activation, involving aberrant proliferation and prehypertrophic differentiation, is essential for osteoarthritis (OA) initiation and progression. Disruption of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes chondrocyte autophagy and survival, and decreases the severity of experimental OA. However, the role of cartilage mTORC1 activation in OA initiation is unknown. In this study, we elucidated the specific role of mTORC1 activation in OA initiation, and identify the underlying mechanisms.\n\n\nMETHOD\nExpression of mTORC1 in articular cartilage of OA patients and OA mice was assessed by immunostaining. Cartilage-specific tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1, mTORC1 upstream inhibitor) knockout (TSC1CKO) and inducible Tsc1 KO (TSC1CKOER) mice were generated. The functional effects of mTORC1 in OA initiation and development on its downstream targets were examined by immunostaining, western blotting and qPCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nArticular chondrocyte mTORC1 was activated in early-stage OA and in aged mice. TSC1CKO mice exhibited spontaneous OA, and TSC1CKOER mice (from 2 months) exhibited accelerated age-related and DMM-induced OA phenotypes, with aberrant chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation. This was associated with hyperactivation of mTORC1 and dramatic downregulation of FGFR3 and PPR, two receptors critical for preventing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Rapamycin treatment reversed these phenotypes in KO mice. Furthermore, in vitro rescue experiments demonstrated that p73 and ERK1/2 may mediate the negative regulation of FGFR3 and PPR by mTORC1.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nmTORC1 activation stimulates articular chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation to initiate OA, in part by downregulating FGFR3 and PPR.",

    "abstract": "The products of the TSC1 (hamartin) and TCS2 (tuberin) tumor suppressor genes negatively regulate cell growth by inhibiting mTOR signaling. Recent research has led to the postulation that tuberin and/or hamartin are involved in tumor migration, presumably through Rho activation. Here we show that LEF-8 cells, which contain a Y1571 missense mutation in tuberin, express higher Rac1 activity than tuberin negative and positive cells. We also provide evidence of obvious lamellipodia formation in LEF-8 cells. Since the production of TSC2(Y1571H) cannot form a hetero-complex with hamartin, we further analyzed another mutant, TSC2(R611Q), which also lacks the ability to form a complex with hamartin. Introducing both forms of mutated TSC2 into COS-1 cells increased Rac1 activity as well as cell motility. We also found these two mutants interacted with Rac1. We further demonstrated that the introduction of mutated TSC2 into COS-1 cells can generate higher reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results indicate that loss-of-function mutated tuberin can activate Rac1 and thereby increase ROS production.",

Neurological manifestations are observed in about 95% cases, representing the most frequent cause of morbidity and one of the most common causes of mortality.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nNeuroimaging is crucial for early diagnosis, monitoring, and management of these patients. While computed tomography is generally used as first-line investigation at emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging is the reference method to define central nervous system involvement and investigate subtle pathophysiological alterations in TSC patients.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nHere, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in TSC brain imaging, describing conventional findings and depicting the role of advanced techniques in providing new insights on the disease, also offering an overview on future perspectives of neuroimaging applications for a better understanding of disease pathophysiology.",

    "issue": "31(5)",
    "pages": "408-418",
    "abstract": "Consumption of kava (Piper methysticum Forst) has been linked to reduced cancer risk in the South Pacific Islands. Kavalactones are major bioactive components in kava root extracts, which have recently demonstrated anti-cancer activities. However, molecular mechanisms of kavalactones' anti-cancer action remain largely unknown. We have identified two kavalactones, yangonin and 5' 6'-dehydrokawain, as potent inducers of autophagic cell death in bladder cancer cells. The effect of yangonin inducing autophagy is associated with increased expression of beclin and ATG5. In addition, yangonin increases the expression of LKB1 and decreases the phosphorylation of Akt, PRAS40, rpS6, p70S6K and 4E-BP1, leading to increased binding of 4E-BP1 to m7 GTP. The growth inhibitory effects of yangonin were attenuated inTSC1 or LKB1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that TSC1 and LKB1 expression may contribute to optimal growth inhibition by yangonin. Furthermore, yangonin reduces the viability of bladder cancer cell lines derived from different stages of human bladder cancer, and acts synergistically with apoptosis-inducing agents such as docetaxel and flavokawain A. Our results support a novel anti-bladder cancer mechanism by yangonin and further studies are needed to assess the potential use of yangonin for bladder cancer prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to identify genomic alterations in Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. This information is vitally important in Taiwan, where endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 14 tumor tissue samples from Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. We used the Genome Analysis Tool kit software package for data analysis, and the dbSNP, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases for comparisons. Variants were validated via Sanger sequencing. We identified 143 non-synonymous mutations in 756 canonical cancer-related genes and 1,271 non-synonymous mutations in non-canonical cancer-related genes in 14 endometrial samples. PTEN, KRAS and PIK3R1 were the most frequently mutated canonical cancer-related genes. Our results revealed nine potential driver genes (MAPT, IL24, MCM6, TSC1, BIRC2, CIITA, DST, CASP8 and NOTCH2) and 21 potential passenger genes (ARMCX4, IGSF10, VPS13C, DCT, DNAH14, TLN1, ZNF605, ZSCAN29, MOCOS, CMYA5, PCDH17, UGT1A8, CYFIP2, MACF1, NUDT5, JAKMIP1, PCDHGB4, FAM178A, SNX6, IMP4 and PCMTD1). The detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the mTOR, Wnt, MAPK, VEGF and ErbB pathways, as well as aberrant DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis pathways. We characterized the mutational landscape and genetic alterations in multiple cellular pathways of endometrial cancer in the Taiwanese population.",

    "issue": "236(3)",
    "pages": "R161-R167",
    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) may arise throughout the body and are a highly heterogeneous, relatively rare class of neoplasms difficult to study also for the lack of disease models. Despite this, knowledge on their molecular alterations has expanded in the latest years, also building from genetic syndromes causing their onset. Pancreatic NETs (PanNETs) have been among the most studied, and research so far has outlined a series of recurring features, as inactivation of MEN1, VHL, TSC1/2 genes and hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Next-generation sequencing has added new information by showing the key role of alternative lengthening of telomeres, driven in a fraction of PanNETs by inactivation of ATRX/DAXX. Despite this accumulation of knowledge, single studies often relied on few cases or were limited to the DNA, RNA, protein or epigenetic level with lack of integrative analysis. The International Cancer Genome Consortium aimed at removing these barriers through a strict process of data and samples collection, to produce whole-genome integrated analyses for many tumour types. The results of this effort on PanNETs have been recently published and, while confirming previous observations provide a first snapshot of how heterogeneous is the combination of genetic alterations that drive this tumour type, yet converging into four pathways whose alteration has been enriched by newly discovered mechanisms. While calling for further integration of genetic and epigenetic analyses, these data allow to reconcile previous findings in a defined frame and may provide clinical research with markers for patients stratification and to guide targeted therapy decisions.",

    "issue": "45(10)",
    "pages": "933-44",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a familial tumor syndrome characterized by the development of hamartomas in the brain, heart, kidney, and skin. Disease-causing mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene result in constitutive activation of the highly conserved mTOR signal transduction pathway, which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (sirolimus), reduces disease severity in rodent models of TSC, and is currently in phase II clinical trials. The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is another potential therapeutic agent for TSC. A high-expressing IFN-gamma allele is associated with a lower frequency of kidney tumors in TSC patients, and treatment with exogenous IFN-gamma reduces the severity of TSC-related disease in mouse models. Here, we examine the effects of treating tumor-bearing nude mice with a combination of a rapamycin analog (CCI-779) and IFN-gamma. We observed that combination therapy was more effective than single agent therapy in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in this mouse model of TSC. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses showed that tumors treated with CCI-779 plus IFN-gamma had decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death in comparison with untreated tumors or tumors treated with either agent alone. We also observed that CCI-779 resistance could develop with prolonged treatment. Taken together, our results show that targeting multiple cellular pathways is an effective strategy for treating TSC-related tumors, and underscore the importance of investigating combination therapy in future clinical trials for patients with TSC.",

    "issue": "53(1)",
    "pages": "101-108",
    "abstract": "It has been 35 years since Professor Thoenes and his colleagues discovered chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Since then, our knowledge about this tumour entity has changed and novel tumour entities have been discovered. The aim of this review is to discuss recent molecular findings and open questions in diagnosing chromophobe-like/oncocytic neoplasms. The broader differential diagnosis of chromophobe-like and oncocytoma-like neoplasms includes SDH-deficient renal cell carcinoma, fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient RCC, epitheloid angiomyolipoma ('oncocytoma like'), MiT family translocation RCC and the emerging entity of eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma. After separation of these tumours from chromophobe RCC, it becomes evident that chromophobe RCC are low malignant tumours with a 5-6% risk of metastasis. Recent next generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation profiling studies have confirmed Thoenes' theory of a distal tubule derived origin of chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytomas. Comprehensive genomic analyses of chromophobe RCC have demonstrated a low somatic mutation rate and identified TP53 and PTEN as the most frequently mutated genes, whereas 'unclassified' RCC with oncocytic or chromophobe-like features can show somatic inactivating mutations of TSC2 or activating mutations of MTOR as the primary molecular alterations. For the future, it would be desirable to create a category of 'oncocytic/chromophobe RCC, NOS' with the potential of further molecular studies for identification of TSC1/2 mutations in these rare tumours.",

    "abstract": "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions to monitor and maintain energy homeostasis at the cellular and organism level. AMPK was perceived historically primarily as a component of the LKB1/STK11 tumor suppressor (LKB1 mutations cause the Peutz-Jegher cancer predisposition syndrome) cascade upstream of the TSC1/2/mTOR pathway and thus likely to be a tumor suppressor. However, AMPK has recently been shown to promote cancer cell survival in the face of extrinsic and intrinsic stressors including bioenergetic, growth factor, and oncogene stress compatible with studies showing that AMPK is required for oncogenic transformation. Thus, whether AMPK acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor or a contextual oncogene and, of particular importance, whether AMPK should be targeted for activation or inhibition during cancer therapy, is controversial and requires clarification. We aim to initiate discussions of these critical questions by reviewing the role of AMPK with an emphasis on cancer cell adaptation to microenvironment stress and therapeutic intervention.",

    "issue": "35(3)",
    "pages": "333-343",
    "abstract": "Low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) of the kidney is a recently described entity with poorly understood pathogenesis. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and complementary approaches, we provide insight into its biology. We describe 22 LOT corresponding to 7 patients presenting with a median age of 75 years (range 63-86 years) and male to female ratio 2:5. All 22 tumors demonstrated prototypical microscopic features. Tumors were well-circumscribed and solid. They were composed of sheets of tumor cells in compact nests. Tumor cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei (without nuclear membrane irregularities), focal subtle perinuclear halos, and occasional binucleation. Sharply delineated edematous stromal islands were often observed. Tumor cells were positive for PAX8, negative for CD117, and exhibited diffuse and strong cytokeratin-7 expression. Six patients presented with pT1 tumors. At a median follow-up of 29 months, four patients were alive without recurrence (three patients had died from unrelated causes). All tumors were originally classified as chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic variant (chRCC-eo). While none of the patients presented with known syndromic features, one patient with multiple bilateral LOTs was subsequently found to have a likely pathogenic germline TSC1 mutation. Somatic, likely activating, mutations in MTOR and RHEB were identified in all other evaluable LOTs. As assessed by phospho-S6 and phospho-4E-BP1, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was activated across all cases but to different extent. MTOR mutant LOT exhibited lower levels of mTORC1 activation, possibly related to mTORC1 dimerization and the preservation of a wild-type MTOR copy (retained chromosome 1). Supporting its distinction from related entities, gene expression analyses showed that LOT clustered separately from classic chRCC, chRCC-eo, and RO. In summary, converging mTORC1 pathway mutations, mTORC1 complex activation, and a distinctive gene expression signature along with characteristic phenotypic features support LOT designation as a distinct entity with both syndromic and non-syndromic cases associated with an indolent course.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare hereditary disease, which results from the mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, and its clinical features include benign tumors and dysfunctions in numerous organs, including the brain. Many individuals with TSC manifest neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as learning impairments, cognitive deficits and anxiety. Current pharmacological treatment for TSC is the use of mTOR inhibitors. However, they are not effective in treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. We previously used curcumin, a diet-derived mTOR inhibitor, which possesses both anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties, to improve learning and memory deficits in Tsc2+/- mice. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides microstructural information in brain tissue and has been used to study the neuropathological changes in TSC. In this study, we confirmed that the impaired recognition memory and increased anxiety-like behavior in Tsc2+/- mice can be reversed by curcumin treatment. Second, we found altered fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus of the Tsc2+/- mice, which may indicate altered circuitry. Finally, the mTOR complex 1 hyperactivity was found in the cortex and hippocampus, coinciding with abnormal cortical myelination and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the hippocampal CA1 of Tsc2+/- mice, both of which can be rescued with curcumin treatment. Overall, DTI is sensitive to the subtle alterations that cannot be detected by conventional imaging, suggesting that noninvasive DTI may be suitable for longitudinally monitoring the in vivo neuropathology associated with the neuropsychiatric symptoms in TSC, thereby facilitating future clinical trials of pharmacological treatments.",

    "issue": "9(1)",
    "pages": "814",
    "abstract": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. Several studies reported that the serine-threonine kinase Lkb1 is dysregulated in PKD. Here we show that genetic ablation of Lkb1 in the embryonic ureteric bud has no effects on tubule formation, maintenance, or growth. However, co-ablation of Lkb1 and Tsc1, an mTOR repressor, results in an early developing, aggressive form of PKD. We find that both loss of Lkb1 and loss of Pkd1 render cells dependent on glutamine for growth. Metabolomics analysis suggests that Lkb1 mutant kidneys require glutamine for non-essential amino acid and glutathione metabolism. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism in both Lkb1/Tsc1 and Pkd1 mutant mice significantly reduces cyst progression. Thus, we identify a role for Lkb1 in glutamine metabolism within the kidney epithelia and suggest that drugs targeting glutamine metabolism may help reduce cyst number and/or size in PKD.",

    "abstract": "The R2TP/Prefoldin-like (R2TP/PFDL) complex has emerged as a cochaperone complex involved in the assembly of a number of critical protein complexes including snoRNPs, nuclear RNA polymerases and PIKK-containing complexes. Here we report on the use of multiple target affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to identify two additional complexes that interact with R2TP/PFDL: the TSC1-TSC2 complex and the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). The interaction between R2TP/PFDL and the U5 snRNP is mostly mediated by the previously uncharacterized factor ZNHIT2. A more general function for the zinc-finger HIT domain in binding RUVBL2 is exposed. Disruption of ZNHIT2 and RUVBL2 expression impacts the protein composition of the U5 snRNP suggesting a function for these proteins in promoting the assembly of the ribonucleoprotein. A possible implication of R2TP/PFDL as a major effector of stress-, energy- and nutrient-sensing pathways that regulate anabolic processes through the regulation of its chaperoning activity is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Many genetic factors play important roles in the development of endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate genetic alterations in the Taiwanese population with endometrial cancer. DNA was extracted from 10 cases of fresh-frozen endometrial cancer tissue. The exomes of cancer-related genes were captured using the NimbleGen Comprehensive Cancer Panel (578 cancer-related genes) and sequenced using the Illumina Genomic Sequencing Platform. Our results revealed 120 variants in 99 genes, 21 of which were included in the Oncomine Cancer Research Panel used in the National Cancer Institute Match Trial. The 21 genes comprised 8 tumor suppressor candidates (ATM, MSH2, PIK3R1, PTCH1, PTEN, TET2, TP53, and TSC1) and 13 oncogene candidates (ALK, BCL9, CTNNB1, ERBB2, FGFR2, FLT3, HNF1A, KIT, MTOR, PDGFRA, PPP2R1A, PTPN11, and SF3B1). We identified a high frequency of mutations in PTEN (50%) and genes involved in the endometrial cancer-related molecular pathway, which involves the IL-7 signaling pathway (PIK3R1, n=1; AKT2, n=1; FOXO1, n=1). We report the mutational landscape of endometrial cancer in the Taiwanese population. We believe that this study will shed new light on fundamental aspects for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of endometrial cancer and may aid in the development of new targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "The small GTPase Rheb displays unique biological and biochemical properties different from other small GTPases and functions as an important mediator between the tumor suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 and the mammalian target of rapamycin to stimulate cell growth. We report here the three-dimensional structures of human Rheb in complexes with GDP, GTP, and GppNHp (5'-(beta,gamma-imide)triphosphate), which reveal novel structural features of Rheb and provide a molecular basis for its distinct properties. During GTP/GDP cycling, switch I of Rheb undergoes conformational change while switch II maintains a stable, unusually extended conformation, which is substantially different from the alpha-helical conformation seen in other small GTPases. The unique switch II conformation results in a displacement of Gln64 (equivalent to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras), making it incapable of participating in GTP hydrolysis and thus accounting for the low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. This rearrangement also creates space to accommodate the side chain of Arg15, avoiding its steric hindrance with the catalytic residue and explaining its noninvolvement in GTP hydrolysis. Unlike Ras, the phosphate moiety of GTP in Rheb is shielded by the conserved Tyr35 of switch I, leading to the closure of the GTP-binding site, which appears to prohibit the insertion of a potential arginine finger from its GTPase-activating protein. Taking the genetic, biochemical, biological, and structural data together, we propose that Rheb forms a new group of the Ras/Rap subfamily and uses a novel GTP hydrolysis mechanism that utilizes Asn1643 of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 GTPase-activating protein domain instead of Gln64 of Rheb as the catalytic residue.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated the characteristics of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) entered into the TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA). Methods: The study was conducted at 170 sites across 31 countries. Data from patients of any age with a documented clinical visit for TSC in the 12 months preceding enrollment or those newly diagnosed with TSC were entered. Results: SEGA were reported in 554 of 2,216 patients (25%). Median age at diagnosis of SEGA was 8 years (range, <1-51), with 18.1% diagnosed after age 18 years. SEGA growth occurred in 22.7% of patients aged ≤ 18 years and in 11.6% of patients aged > 18 years. SEGA were symptomatic in 42.1% of patients. Symptoms included increased seizure frequency (15.8%), behavioural disturbance (11.9%), and regression/loss of cognitive skills (9.9%), in addition to those typically associated with increased intracranial pressure. SEGA were significantly more frequent in patients with TSC2 compared to TSC1 variants (33.7 vs. 13.2 %, p < 0.0001). Main treatment modalities included surgery (59.6%) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (49%). Conclusions: Although SEGA diagnosis and growth typically occurs during childhood, SEGA can occur and grow in both infants and adults.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive cystic lung disease with features of a low-grade neoplasm. It is primarily caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), slows down disease progression in some, but not all patients. Hitherto, other potential therapeutic targets such as mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and various metabolic pathways have not been investigated in human LAM tissues. The aim of this study was to assess activities of mTORC1, mTORC2 and various metabolic pathways in human LAM tissues through analysis of protein expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-S6 (mTORC1 downstream protein), Rictor (mTORC2 scaffold protein) as well as GLUT1, GAPDH, ATPB, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A (metabolic pathway markers) were performed on lung tissue from 11 patients with sporadic LAM. Immunoreactivity was assessed in LAM cells with bronchial smooth muscle cells as controls. Expression of p-S6, Rictor, GAPDH, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A was significantly higher in LAM cells than in bronchial smooth muscle cells (P<.01). No significant differences were found between LAM cells and normal bronchial smooth muscle cells in GLUT1 and ATPB expression. The results are uniquely derived from human tissue and indicate that, in addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 may also play an important role in the pathobiology of LAM. Furthermore, glutaminolysis, acetate utilization and fatty acid β-oxidation appear to be the preferred bioenergetic pathways in LAM cells. mTORC2 and these preferred bioenergetic pathways appear worthy of further study as they may represent possible therapeutic targets in the treatment of LAM.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease causing multisystem growth of benign tumours and other hamartomatous lesions, which leads to diverse and debilitating clinical symptoms. Patients are born with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and somatic inactivation of wild-type alleles drives MTOR activation; however, second hits to TSC1/TSC2 are not always observed. Here, we present the genomic landscape of TSC hamartomas. We determine that TSC lesions contain a low somatic mutational burden relative to carcinomas, a subset feature large-scale chromosomal aberrations, and highly conserved molecular signatures for each type exist. Analysis of the molecular signatures coupled with computational approaches reveals unique aspects of cellular heterogeneity and cell origin. Using immune data sets, we identify significant neuroinflammation in TSC-associated brain tumours. Taken together, this molecular catalogue of TSC serves as a resource into the origin of these hamartomas and provides a framework that unifies genomic and transcriptomic dimensions for complex tumours.",

    "issue": "76(24)",
    "pages": "7130-7139",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multiorgan disorder characterized by the development of neoplastic lesions in kidney, lung, brain, heart, and skin. It is caused by an inactivating mutation in tumor suppressor genes coding the TSC1/TSC2 complex, resulting in the hyperactivation of mTOR- and Raf/MEK/MAPK-dependent signaling that stimulates tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Despite its oncogenic effect, cells with TSC deficiency were more sensitive to oxidative stress and dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, providing a rationale for a new therapeutic approach. The current study shows that simultaneous inhibition of two major pathways regulating redox homeostasis using l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO, glutathione synthesis inhibitor) and auranofin (thioredoxin reductase inhibitor) induces oxidative burst, mitochondrial damage, and necrotic cell death in TSC-deficient cells in a highly synergistic and cell context-specific manner. Furthermore, blocking RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-dependent signaling using chemical inhibitors necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and necrosulfonamide (NSA) synergizes with BSO and auranofin in killing TSC-deficient cells. Expression analysis demonstrated that RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL protein levels are elevated in cells with TSC2 deficiency, and their inactivation enhances mitochondrial dysfunction in a glutaminolysis-dependent and autophagy-independent manner. Finally, supplementation with the mitochondrial metabolite α-ketoglutarate, whose synthesis is regulated by RIP1/RIP3/MLKL, rescues cells from the sensitizing effect of Nec-1 and NSA. Together, this study identifies a previously unrecognized novel regulated necrotic death pathway that involves mitochondrial homeostasis, is suppressed by the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL signaling in TSC-deficient cells, and could be a promising therapeutic target for TSC-associated tumors.

    "pages": "273-80",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis (TS), autosomal dominant disorder manifested by the formation of usually benign tumors in the brain, heart, kidneys and skin, results from an inactivating mutation in one of two tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. Protein products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have been shown to participate in the mTOR pathway controlling translation of approx. 10-15% of all proteins. In the current paper, we aimed at verifying whether hamartin and tuberin may also be implicated in the control of gene transcription. Very recently it has been hypothesized that the pathway triggered by WNT, one of embryonic growth factors involved in cell differentiation and migration, could be disturbed in TS. In order to test this hypothesis we evaluated samples of four subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), brain tumors developing in the progress of TS. We found that beta-catenin, transcription factor and mediator of WNT pathway activity is indeed present and active in SEGAs. mRNA transcripts for c-Myc and N-Myc, proteins whose transcription is regulated by beta-catenin, were upregulated in two of four SEGAs, while cyclin D1 mRNA was significantly higher in three SEGAs. At the same time, c-Myc and N-Myc proteins were detected in the same two samples. Thus, we show for the first time that aberrant WNT signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of TS-associated SEGAs.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME) are epileptogenic neurodevelopmental malformations caused by mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Deep sequencing of these genes in FCD/HME brain tissue identified an etiology in 27 of 66 cases (41%). Radiographically indistinguishable lesions are caused by somatic activating mutations in AKT3, MTOR, and PIK3CA and germline loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5, NPRL2, and TSC1/2, including TSC2 mutations in isolated HME demonstrating a \"two-hit\" model. Mutations in the same gene cause a disease continuum from FCD to HME to bilateral brain overgrowth, reflecting the progenitor cell and developmental time when the mutation occurred. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated mTOR activation in neurons in all lesions. Conditional Pik3ca activation in the mouse cortex showed that mTOR activation in excitatory neurons and glia, but not interneurons, is sufficient for abnormal cortical overgrowth. These data suggest that mTOR activation in dorsal telencephalic progenitors, in some cases specifically the excitatory neuron lineage, causes cortical dysplasia.",

    "issue": "10()",
    "pages": "340",
    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette Sydrome (TS) is a childhood onset neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized phenotypically by the presence of multiple motor and vocal tics. It is often accompanied by multiple psychiatric comorbidities, with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among the most common. The extensive co-occurrence of the two disorders suggests a shared genetic background. A major step toward the elucidation of the genetic architecture of TS was undertaken by the first TS Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) reporting 552 SNPs that were moderately associated with TS (p < 1E-3). Similarly, initial ADHD GWAS attempts and meta-analysis were not able to produce genome-wide significant findings, but have provided insight to the genetic basis of the disorder. Here, we examine the common genetic background of the two neuropsychiatric phenotypes, by meta-analyzing the 552 top hits in the TS GWAS with the results of ADHD first GWASs. We identify 19 significant SNPs, with the top four implicated genes being TBC1D7, GUCY1A3, RAP1GDS1, and CHST11. TBCD17 harbors the top scoring SNP, rs1866863 (p:3.23E-07), located in a regulatory region downstream of the gene, and the third best-scoring SNP, rs2458304 (p:2.54E-06), located within an intron of the gene. Both variants were in linkage disequilibrium with eQTL rs499818, indicating a role in the expression levels of the gene. TBC1D7 is the third subunit of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathway, with a central role in cell growth and autophagy. The top genes implicated by our study indicate a complex and intricate interplay between them, warranting further investigation into a possibly shared etiological mechanism for TS and ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers with different histologic subtypes. The majority of renal tumors in adults are clear cell renal cell carcinomas, which are characterized by von Hippel- Lindau (VHL) gene alterations. Recent advances in defining the genetic landscape of renal cancer has shown the genetic heterogeneity of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) and the presence of at least 3 additional ccRCC tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 3p. Due to inactivation of VHL, renal cancer cells produce the HIF-responsive growth factor VEGF. The PI3K--mTORC1 signaling axis also represents a target for therapy. The new systemic therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and mTOR inhibitors, aim to suppress angiogenesis with vascular endothelial growth factor as a target. Various VEGF-inhibitors are approved for the treatment of ccRCC and we discuss recent advancements in the treatment of metastatic ccRCC. Other gene alterations have been identified in hereditary cancer syndromes, e.g. FLCN, TSC1, TSC2, TFE3, TFEB, MITF, FH, SDHB, SDHD, MET, and PTEN and we review their role in renal tumor carcinogenesis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. By reviewing the associations between morphologic features and molecular genetics of renal cancer we provide insight into the basis for targeted renal cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) disease is associated with tumors in many organs, particularly angiomyolipoma (AML) in the kidneys. Loss or inactivation of TSC1/2 results in high levels of HIF-α activity and VEGF expression. mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) and the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA)-riboside (AICAR) are currently used separately to treat cancer patients. Here, we investigated the effect of a novel combination of rapamycin and AICAR on tumor progression. Our data show that treatment of AML human cells with drug combinations resulted in 5-7-fold increase in cell apoptosis compared to each drug alone. In addition, drug combinations resulted in 4-5-fold decrease in cell proliferation compared to each drug alone. We found that drug combinations abolished Akt and HIF activity in AML cells. The drug combinations resulted in decrease in cell invasion and cell immigration by 70% and 84%, respectively in AML cells. The combined drugs also significantly decreased the VEGF expression compare to each drug alone in AML cells. Drug combinations effectively abolished binding of HIF-2α to the putative Akt site in the nuclear extracts isolated from AML cells. Treatment TSC mice with drug combinations resulted in 75% decrease in tumor number and 88% decrease in tumor volume compared to control TSC mice. This is first evidence that drug combinations are effective in reducing size and number of kidney tumors without any toxic effect on kidney. These data will provide evidence for initiating a new clinical trial for treatment of TSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic, multisystemic disorder characterized by circumscribed benign lesions (hamartomas) in several organs, including brain. This is the result of defects in the TSC1 and/or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes, encoding the hamartin-tuberin complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Specific inhibitors of this pathway have been shown to reduce the volume of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis. Congenital lymphedema is rarely seen in association with tuberous sclerosis, with only a few reported cases. Although this association can be coincidental, the dysgenetic lymphatic system can represent a hamartia as a consequence of gene mutation. We describe a child with congenital lymphedema in tuberous sclerosis and associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma who experienced lymphangitis under treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Because our patient did not show worsening of lymphedema, congenital lymphedema does not seem to be a contraindication for this therapy.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an established therapeutic target in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Mechanisms of secondary resistance to rapalog therapy in RCC have not been studied previously. We identified six patients with metastatic RCC who initially responded to mTOR inhibitor therapy and then progressed, and had pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor samples available for analysis. We performed deep whole exome sequencing on the paired tumor samples and a blood sample. Sequence data was analyzed using Mutect, CapSeg, Absolute, and Phylogic to identify mutations, copy number changes, and their changes over time. We also performed in vitro functional assays on PBRM1 in RCC cell lines. Five patients had clear cell and one had chromophobe RCC. 434 somatic mutations in 416 genes were identified in the 12 tumor samples. 201 (46%) of mutations were clonal in both samples while 129 (30%) were acquired in the post-treatment samples. Tumor heterogeneity or sampling issues are likely to account for some mutations that were acquired in the post-treatment samples. Three samples had mutations in TSC1; one in PTEN; and none in MTOR. PBRM1 was the only gene in which mutations were acquired in more than one post-treatment sample. We examined the effect of PBRM1 loss in multiple RCC cell lines, and could not identify any effect on rapalog sensitivity in in vitro culture assays. We conclude that mTOR pathway gene mutations did not contribute to rapalog resistance development in these six patients with advanced RCC. Furthermore, mechanisms of resistance to rapalogs in RCC remain unclear and our results suggest that PBRM1 loss may contribute to sensitivity through complex transcriptional effects.",

BRAF abnormalities are observed in pilocytic astrocytomas (tandem duplication-rearrangement) and in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (BRAF V600E mutation). The vast majority of primary or de novo glioblastomas exhibit genetic abnormalities disrupting the intracellular signaling pathways of: transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors to growth factors and their downstream signaling pathways (i.e. NF1-RAS-RAF-MAPK and PTEN-PI3K-AKT-TSC-mTOR); RB and; TP53. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are frequent in diffuse grade II and grade III gliomas and in secondary glioblastomas. They are diagnostic and favorable independent prognostic biomarkers. In contrast, they are rare in primary or de novo glioblastomas and not reported in pilocytic astrocytomas. Germlin mutations in MSH2/MLH1/PMS2/MSH6, CDKN2A, TSC1/TSC2, PTEN, TP53 and NF1/NF2 predispose to glial tumors in the setting of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TERT,CCDC26, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, RTEL, EGFR and PHLDB1 confer an inherited susceptibility to glial tumors.",

We investigated the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with everolimus and pazopanib (E/P) in genomically profiled patients with mUC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nmUC patients enrolled on a Phase I dose escalation study and an expansion cohort treated with E/P were included. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR); secondary end points were safety, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients were assessed for mutations and copy number alterations in 300 relevant cancer-associated genes using next-generation sequencing and findings were correlated with outcomes. Time-to-event data were estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 23 patients enrolled overall, 19 had mUC. ORR was 21% (one complete response (CR), three partial responses (PR), eight with stable disease (SD). DOR, PFS and OS were 6.5, 3.6, and 9.1 months, respectively. Four patients with clinical benefit (one CR, two PR, one SD) had mutations in TSC1/TSC2 or mTOR and a 5th patient with PR had a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination therapy with E/P is safe in mUC and select patients with alterations in mTOR or FGFR pathways derive significant clinical benefit.",

    "issue": "101(Pt B)",
    "pages": "106581",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletions in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that is associated with epilepsy in up to 90% of patients. Seizures are suggested to start in benign brain tumors, cortical tubers, or in the perituberal tissue making these tubers an interesting target for further research into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in TSC. Animal models of TSC insufficiently capture the neurodevelopmental biology of cortical tubers, and hence, human stem cell-based in vitro models of TSC are being increasingly explored in attempts to recapitulate tuber development and epileptogenesis in TSC. However, in vitro culture conditions for stem cell-derived neurons do not necessarily mimic physiological conditions. For example, very high glucose concentrations of up to 25 mM are common in culture media formulations. As TSC is potentially caused by a disruption of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, a main integrator of metabolic information and intracellular signaling, we aimed to examine the impact of different glucose concentrations in the culture media on cellular phenotypes implicated in tuber characteristics. Here, we present preliminary data from a pilot study exploring cortical neuronal differentiation on human embryonic stem cells (hES) harboring a TSC2 knockout mutation (TSC2-/-) and an isogenic control line (TSC2+/+). We show that the commonly used high glucose media profoundly mask cellular phenotypes in TSC2-/- cultures during neuronal differentiation. These phenotypes only become apparent when differentiating TSC2+/+ and TSC2-/- cultures in more physiologically relevant conditions of 5 mM glucose suggesting that the careful consideration of culture conditions is vital to ensuring biological relevance and translatability of stem cell models for neurological disorders such as TSC.

    "pages": "1908-20",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with pleiotropic manifestations caused by heterozygous mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. One of the less investigated complications of TSC is the formation of aneurysms of the descending aorta, which are characterized on pathologic examination by smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in the aortic media. SMCs were explanted from Tsc2(+/-) mice to investigate the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms caused by TSC2 mutations. Tsc2(+/-) SMCs demonstrated increased phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), S6 and p70S6K and increased proliferation rates compared with wild-type (WT) SMCs. Tsc2(+/-) SMCs also had reduced expression of SMC contractile proteins compared with WT SMCs. An inhibitor of mTOR signaling, rapamycin, decreased SMC proliferation and increased contractile protein expression in the Tsc2(+/-) SMCs to levels similar to WT SMCs. Exposure to alpha-elastin fragments also decreased proliferation of Tsc2(+/-) SMCs and increased levels of p27(kip1), but failed to increase expression of contractile proteins. In response to artery injury using a carotid artery ligation model, Tsc2(+/-) mice significantly increased neointima formation compared with the control mice, and the neointima formation was inhibited by treatment with rapamycin. These results demonstrate that Tsc2 haploinsufficiency in SMCs increases proliferation and decreases contractile protein expression and suggest that the increased proliferative potential of the mutant cells may be suppressed in vivo by interaction with elastin. These findings provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of aortic disease in TSC patients and identify a potential therapeutic target for treatment of this complication of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. TSC is characterized by multiple tumors of the brain, kidney, heart, and skin. Tuberin and hamartin inhibit signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) but there are limited studies of their involvement in other pathways controlling cell growth. Using ELT-3 cells, which are Eker rat-derived smooth muscle cells, we show that ELT-3 cells expressing tuberin (TSC2+/+) respond to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation by activating the classic mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-1-dependent phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase (MAPK) with nuclear translocation of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK. In contrast, in tuberin-deficient ELT-3 cells (TSC2-/-), PDGF stimulation results in MEK-1-independent p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation with reduced nuclear localization of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK. Moreover, in TSC2-/- cells but not in TSC2+/+ cells, cellular growth and activation of p42/44 MAPK by PDGF requires the reactive oxygen species intermediate, superoxide anion (O2*-). Both baseline and PDGF-induced O2*- levels were significantly higher in TSC2-/- cells and were reduced by treatment with rapamycin and inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport. Furthermore, the exogenous production of O2*- by the redox cycling compound menadione induced MEK-1-independent cellular growth and p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation in TSC2-/- cells but not in TSC2+/+ cells. Together, our data suggest that loss of tuberin, which causes mTOR activation, leads to a novel cellular growth-promoting pathway involving mitochondrial oxidant-dependent p42/44 MAPK activation and mitogenic growth responses to PDGF.",

    "abstract": "The identification of cancer-associated mutations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) highlights the prevailing notion that aberrant metabolic function can contribute to carcinogenesis. IDH1/2 normally catalyse the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (αKG). In gliomas and acute myeloid leukaemias, IDH1/2 mutations confer gain-of-function leading to production of the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from αKG. Here we show that generation of 2HG by mutated IDH1/2 leads to the activation of mTOR by inhibiting KDM4A, an αKG-dependent enzyme of the Jumonji family of lysine demethylases. Furthermore, KDM4A associates with the DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), a negative regulator of mTORC1/2. Depletion of KDM4A decreases DEPTOR protein stability. Our results provide an additional molecular mechanism for the oncogenic activity of mutant IDH1/2 by revealing an unprecedented link between TCA cycle defects and positive modulation of mTOR function downstream of the canonical PI3K/AKT/TSC1-2 pathway.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES\nThe incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing. Previous studies indicated that Liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, could regulate glucose homeostasis as a valuable treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. However, the precise effect of Liraglutide on NAFLD model in rats and the mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Liraglutide ameliorates hepatic steatosis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced rat model of NAFLD in vivo and in vitro.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nNALFD rat models and hepatocyte steatosis in HepG2 cells were induced by HFD and palmitate fatty acid treatment, respectively. AMPK inhibitor, Compound C was added in HepG2 cells. Autophagy-related proteins LC3, Beclin1 and Atg7, and AMPK pathway-associated proteins were evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLiraglutide enhanced autophagy as showed by the increased expression of the autophagy markers LC3, Beclin1 and Atg7 in HFD rats and HepG2 cells treated with palmitate fatty acid. In vitro, The AMPK inhibitor exhibited an inhibitory effect on Liraglutide-induced autophagy enhancement with the deceased expression of LC3, Beclin1 and Atg7. Additionally, Liraglutide treatment elevated AMPK levels and TSC1, decreased p-mTOR expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiraglutide could upregulate autophagy to decrease lipid over-accumulation via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.",

    "issue": "8()",
    "pages": "9",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disorder that results from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, leading to constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Cortical tubers represent typical lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) in TSC. The pattern of cortical layering disruption observed in brain tissue of TSC patients is not yet fully understood, and little is known about the origin and phenotype of individual abnormal cell types recognized in tubers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the present study, we aimed to characterize dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and giant cells (GCs) of cortical tubers using neocortical layer-specific markers (NeuN, SMI32, Tbr1, Satb2, Cux2, ER81, and RORβ) and to compare the features with the histo-morphologically similar focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIb. We studied a cohort of nine surgically resected cortical tubers, five FCD type IIb, and four control samples using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCortical tuber displayed a prominent cell loss in all cortical layers. Moreover, we observed altered proportions of layer-specific markers within the dysplastic region. DNs, in both tubers and FCD type IIb, were found positive for different cortical layer markers, regardless of their laminar location, and their immunophenotype resembles that of cortical projection neurons.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings demonstrate that, similar to FCD type IIb, cortical layering is markedly disturbed in cortical tubers of TSC patients. Distribution of these disturbances is comparable in all tubers and suggests a dysmaturation affecting early and late migratory patterns, with a more severe impairment of the late stage of maturation.",

    "abstract": "LIN28A/B are RNA binding proteins implicated by genetic association studies in human growth and glucose metabolism. Mice with ectopic over-expression of Lin28a have shown related phenotypes. Here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of the physiologic consequences of Lin28a and Lin28b deficiency in knockout (KO) mice. Lin28a/b-deficiency led to dwarfism starting at different ages, and compound gene deletions showed a cumulative dosage effect on organismal growth. Conditional gene deletion at specific developmental stages revealed that fetal but neither neonatal nor adult deficiency resulted in growth defects and aberrations in glucose metabolism. Tissue-specific KO mice implicated skeletal muscle-deficiency in the abnormal programming of adult growth and metabolism. The effects of Lin28b KO could be rescued by Tsc1 haplo-insufficiency in skeletal muscles. Our data implicate fetal expression of Lin28a/b in the regulation of life-long effects on metabolism and growth, and demonstrate that fetal Lin28b acts at least in part via mTORC1 signaling.",

    "issue": "281(52)",
    "pages": "40242-51",
    "abstract": "Both TSC2 (tuberin) and forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 are phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt and play important roles in insulin signaling. However, little is known about the relationship between TSC2 and FoxO1. Here we identified TSC2 as a FoxO1-binding protein by using a yeast two-hybrid screening with a murine islet cDNA library. Among FoxOs, only FoxO1 can be associated with TSC2. The physical association between the C terminus of TSC2 (amino acids 1280-1499) and FoxO1 degrades the TSC1-TSC2 complex and inhibits GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC2 toward Rheb. Overexpression of wild type FoxO1 enhances p70 S6K phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of TSC2 can reverse these effects. Knockdown of endogenous FOXO1 in human vascular endothelial cells decreased phosphorylation of p70 S6K. Prolonged overexpression of wild type FoxO1 enhanced phosphorylation of serine 307 of IRS1 and decreased phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 itself even in the presence of serum. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which FoxO1 regulates the insulin signaling pathway through negative regulation of TSC2 function.",

    "abstract": "In de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPS), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.3)/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.10) (ATIC) catalyzes the last two reactions of the pathway: conversion of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide [aka Z-nucleotide monophosphate (ZMP)] to 5-formamido-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR) then to inosine monophosphate (IMP). Mutations in ATIC cause an untreatable and devastating inborn error of metabolism in humans. ZMP is an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) mimetic and a known activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recently, a HeLa cell line null mutant for ATIC was constructed via CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. This mutant, crATIC, accumulates ZMP during purine starvation. Given that the mutant can accumulate ZMP in the absence of treatment with exogenous compounds, crATIC is likely an important cellular model of DNPS inactivation and ZMP accumulation. In the current study, we characterize the crATIC transcriptome versus the HeLa transcriptome in purine-supplemented and purine-depleted growth conditions. We report and discuss transcriptome changes with particular relevance to Alzheimer's disease and in genes relevant to lipid and fatty acid synthesis, neurodevelopment, embryogenesis, cell cycle maintenance and progression, extracellular matrix, immune function, TGFβ and other cellular processes.",

    "title": "The GST-BHMT assay reveals a distinct mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced macroautophagy in mammalian cells.",
    "issue": "11(5)",
    "pages": "812-32",
    "abstract": "By monitoring the fragmentation of a GST-BHMT (a protein fusion of glutathionine S-transferase N-terminal to betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) reporter in lysosomes, the GST-BHMT assay has previously been established as an endpoint, cargo-based assay for starvation-induced autophagy that is largely nonselective. Here, we demonstrate that under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inhibition by either pharmaceutical or genetic manipulations induces similar autophagy-dependent GST-BHMT processing. However, mechanistically this proteasome inhibition-induced autophagy is different from that induced by starvation as it does not rely on regulation by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase]) and PRKAA/AMPK (protein kinase, AMP-activated, α catalytic subunit), the upstream central sensors of cellular nutrition and energy status, but requires the presence of the cargo receptors SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) that are normally involved in the selective autophagy pathway. Further, it depends on ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress signaling, in particular ERN1/IRE1 (endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1) and its main downstream effector MAPK8/JNK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), but not XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), by regulating the phosphorylation-dependent disassociation of BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) from BECN1 (Beclin 1, autophagy related). Moreover, the multimerization domain of GST-BHMT is required for its processing in response to proteasome inhibition, in contrast to its dispensable role in starvation-induced processing. Together, these findings support a model in which under nutrient-rich conditions, proteasome inactivation induces autophagy-dependent processing of the GST-BHMT reporter through a distinct mechanism that bears notable similarity with the yeast Cvt (cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting) pathway, and suggest the GST-BHMT reporter might be employed as a convenient assay to study selective macroautophagy in mammalian cells.",

    "pages": "85",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBirt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal genodermatosis and caused by germline mutation of the folliculin (FLCN) gene, a tumor suppressor gene of which protein product is involved in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway regulating cell growth and metabolism. Clinical manifestations in BHD syndrome is characterized by fibrofolliculomas of the skin, pulmonary cysts with or without spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal neoplasms. There has been no pulmonary neoplasm reported in BHD syndrome, although the condition is due to deleterious sequence variants in a tumor suppressor gene. Here we report, for the first time to our knowledge, a patient with BHD syndrome who was complicated with a clear cell \"sugar\" tumor (CCST) of the lung, a benign tumor belonging to perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) with frequent causative relation to tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or 2 (TSC2) gene.\n\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nIn a 38-year-old Asian woman, two well-circumscribed nodules in the left lung and multiple thin-walled, irregularly shaped cysts on the basal and medial area of the lungs were disclosed by chest roentgenogram and computer-assisted tomography (CT) during a preoperative survey for a bilateral faucial tonsillectomy. Analysis of the resected tumor showed large polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm proliferating in a solid pattern. Immunohistochemistry revealed that these tumor cells were positive for microphthalmia-transcription factor, S100, and CD1a but negative for HMB45, indicating that the tumor was a CCST. Genetic testing indicated that the patient had a germline mutation on exon 12 of the FLCN gene, i.e., insertion of 7 nucleotides (CCACCCT) (c.1347_1353dupCCACCCT). Direct sequencing of the FLCN exon 12 using genomic DNA obtained from her microdissected CCST cells clearly revealed loss of the wild-type FLCN sequence, which confirmed complete functional loss of the FLCN gene. On the other hand, no loss of heterozygosity around TCS1- or TSC2-associated genetic region was demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of CCST of the lung in a patient with BHDS, indicating that CCST should be added to the spectrum of pulmonary manifestations of BHDS.",

    "abstract": "The utility of tumor-derived cell lines is dependent on their ability to recapitulate underlying genomic aberrations and primary tumor biology. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 25 bladder cancer (BCa) cell lines and compared mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), gene expression and drug response to BCa patient profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We observed a mutation pattern associated with altered CpGs and APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases similar to mutation signatures derived from somatic alterations in muscle-invasive (MI) primary tumors, highlighting a major mechanism(s) contributing to cancer-associated alterations in the BCa cell line exomes. Non-silent sequence alterations were confirmed in 76 cancer-associated genes, including mutations that likely activate oncogenes TERT and PIK3CA, and alter chromatin-associated proteins (MLL3, ARID1A, CHD6 and KDM6A) and established BCa genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A and TSC1). We identified alterations in signaling pathways and proteins with related functions, including the PI3K/mTOR pathway, altered in 60% of lines; BRCA DNA repair, 44%; and SYNE1-SYNE2, 60%. Homozygous deletions of chromosome 9p21 are known to target the cell cycle regulators CDKN2A and CDKN2B. This loci was commonly lost in BCa cell lines and we show the deletions extended to the polyamine enzyme methylthioadenosine (MTA) phosphorylase (MTAP) in 36% of lines, transcription factor DMRTA1 (27%) and antiviral interferon epsilon (IFNE, 19%). Overall, the BCa cell line genomic aberrations were concordant with those found in BCa patient tumors. We used gene expression and copy number data to infer pathway activities for cell lines, then used the inferred pathway activities to build a predictive model of cisplatin response. When applied to platinum-treated patients gathered from TCGA, the model predicted treatment-specific response. Together, these data and analysis represent a valuable community resource to model basic tumor biology and to study the pharmacogenomics of BCa.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by facial angiofibromas, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and the development of hamartomas in several organs, including the heart, kidneys, brain, and lungs. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 result in dysregulated mTOR activation, leading to the occurrence of TSC.\n\n\nPATIENT CONCERNS\nA 44-year-old man was hospitalized for acute lumbago and hematuria.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS\nThe patient presented with facial angiofibromas, epilepsy, fibrous plaques, periungual fibroma, renal angiomyolipomas (AML), pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), liver hamartomas, and osteosclerosis. A diagnosis of TSC was made based on clinical manifestations.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to screen for potential variants, which were verified using Sanger sequencing. The final variant was analyzed using a minigene assay.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nA potentially pathogenic novel TSC2 variant (NM_000548.4, c.336_336 + 15delGGTAAGGCCCAGGGCG) was identified using NGS and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The in vitro minigene assay showed that the variant c.336_336 + 15delGGTAAGGCCCAGGGCG caused erroneous integration of a 74 bp sequence into intron 4. This novel variant was not found in his unaffected parents or 100 unrelated healthy controls.\n\n\nLESSONS\nWe identified a novel heterozygous TSC2 variant, c.336_336 + 15delGGTAAGGCCCAGGGCG, in a patient with classical TSC and demonstrated that this variant leads to aberrant splicing using a minigene assay. Our results extend the understanding of the mutational spectrum of TSC2.",

    "pages": "1566-78",
    "abstract": "Autophagy resembles a recycling process in which proteins, organelles, or regions of the cytoplasm are enveloped and degraded. We have found that two of the central autophagy proteins, MAP1LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, also described as LC3) and UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated/UV radiation associated gene), complex with PGRMC1/S2R (progesterone receptor membrane component 1, also known as sigma-2 receptor). PGRMC1 is a cytochrome that is induced in cancer and is essential for tumor formation, invasion, and metastasis. Autophagy contributes to the turnover of long-lived and/or ubiquitinated proteins and the clearance of damaged organelles, and we have shown that PGRMC1 promotes both processes. Inhibition of PGRMC1 by RNAi or small molecule inhibitors causes autophagy substrates to increase and aberrant mitochondria to accumulate. We propose that this disruption of autophagy upon PGRMC1 inhibition increases AMPK activation, elevating the levels of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex) and TSC2 and inactivating MTOR and RPS6KB/p70S6K, causing cleaved MAP1LC3B levels to increase. Thus, PGRMC1 binds to key components of the autophagy machinery and is required for the degradative activity of autophagy.",

AKT kinases regulate diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation and survival, cell size and response to nutrient availability, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. Many oncoproteins and tumor suppressors implicated in cell signaling/metabolic regulation converge within the AKT signal transduction pathway in an equilibrium that is altered in many human cancers by activating and inactivating mechanisms, respectively, targeting these inter-related proteins. We review a burgeoning literature implicating aberrant AKT signaling in many sporadic human cancers as well as in several dominantly inherited cancer syndromes known as phakomatoses. The latter include disorders caused by germline mutations of certain tumor suppressor genes, that is, PTEN, TSC2/TSC1, LKB1, NF1, and VHL, encoding proteins that intersect with the AKT pathway. We also review various pathogenic mechanisms contributing to activation of the AKT pathway in human malignancy as well as current pharmacologic strategies to target therapeutically components of this pathway.",

Recent work has implicated various genes involved in DNA repair pathways in the pathophysiology of a subset of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, including BRCA2, via the homologous recombination pathway (HRD). To date, germline variants in other HRD pathway genes have not been described to contribute to NEN. PALB2, RAD51C, and BARD1 are additional tumor suppressor genes which also mediate repair of double stranded DNA breaks through the HRD pathway and are implicated in hereditary breast (PALB2; BARD1) and ovarian (RAD51C) cancer. Here we report three cases of NEN associated with germline pathogenic variants in PALB2 (pancreatic NEN), RAD51C (thymic NEN), and BARD1 (pancreaticoduodenal NEN) respectively, further linking the DNA repair pathway to NENs.",

    "abstract": "The role of miRNAs with tumor suppressive activity in liver cancer has been well studied. However, little is known about potential oncomiRs in HCC. In our study, we conducted a systematic evaluation of candidate oncomiRs and found that upregulation of miR-18a and miR-25 in HCC was associated with poor patient survival and promoted proliferation in HCC cell lines. These two miRNAs belong to the polycistronic paralogous miR-17-92 and miR-25-106b clusters respectively. Although the members of both clusters are often upregulated in HCC, the contribution of individual miRNAs in these clusters to HCC tumorigenesis is not fully understood. We validated SOCS5 as a bona fide target of both miRNAs, and established, for the first time, the tumor suppressive role of SOCS5 in liver cancer.

    "issue": "16(4-5)",
    "pages": "487-501",
    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common feature of most solid tumors which negatively impacts their treatment response. This is due in part to the biological changes that result from a coordinated cellular response to hypoxia. A large part of this response is driven by a transcriptional program initiated via stabilization of HIF, promoting both angiogenesis and cell survival. However, hypoxia also results in a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis which occurs through the repression of the initiation step of mRNA translation. This inhibition is fully reversible and occurs in all cell lines tested to date. Inhibition of translation is mediated by two distinct mechanisms during hypoxia. The first is through phosphorylation and inhibition of an essential eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2alpha. Phosphorylation of this factor occurs through activation of the PERK kinase as part of a coordinated ER stress response program known as the UPR. Activation of this program promotes cell survival during hypoxia and facilitates tumor growth. Translation during hypoxia can also be inhibited through the inactivation of a second eukaryotic initiation complex, eIF4F. At least part of this inhibition is mediated through a REDD1 and TSC1/TSC2 dependent inhibition of the mTOR kinase. Inhibition of mRNA translation is hypothesized to affect the cellular tolerance to hypoxia in part by promoting energy homeostasis. However, regulation of translation also results in a specific increase in the synthesis of a subset of hypoxia induced proteins. Consequently, both arms of translational control during hypoxia influence hypoxia induced gene expression and the hypoxic phenotype.",

    "pages": "37-40",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver. Rhabdomyoma is the most common cardiac tumor diagnosed in fetuses, neonates and infants, and is closely linked to TSC. Here we describe an autopsy case of right ventricular rhabdomyoma in TSC. The deceased was a 3-month-old male infant, and TSC with a cardiac tumor had been diagnosed before his death. Since the cardiac tumor had not been physically blocking the blood flow, he had not undergone surgical intervention. At autopsy, the patient's height was 62 cm and his body weight was 6 kg. The heart weighed 37.3 g and the right ventricle was filled with the tumor. The tumor measured 2.1 cm × 1.6 cm, being a fusion of multiple tumors with several attachment sites to the myocardium. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a rhabdomyoma, and was positive for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The brain weighed 795.0 g, without hydrocephalus. The cut surface of the brain revealed multiple cortical tubers and subependymal nodules. Through screening for the TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin) genes, a nonsense mutation, c.1108C>T:p.Gln370∗, was detected in the TSC2 gene. Immediate cause of death was determined to be ventricular obstruction by a cardiac rhabdomyoma with insidious growth. This case highlights the need for forensic pathologists to perform a complete autopsy to determine the cause of sudden death with cardiac tumor, including genetic examination.",

    "issue": "1863(6 Pt A)",
    "pages": "1200-7",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) disease results from inactivation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, and is characterized by benign tumors in several organs. Because TSC tumorigenesis correlates with hyperactivation of mTORC1, current therapies focus on mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin or its analogs. Rapamycin-induced tumor shrinkage has been reported, but tumor recurrence occurs on withdrawal from rapamycin. Autophagy has been associated with development of TSC tumors and with tumor cell survival during rapamycin treatment. mTORC1 and AMPK directly inhibit and activate autophagy, respectively. AMPK is hyperactivated in TSC cells and tumors, and drives cytoplasmic sequestration of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27KIP (p27). Whether AMPK and p27 are involved in rapamycin-induced autophagy and survival of TSC cells remain unexplored. Here, we show that inhibition of AMPK by compound C or by shRNA-mediated depletion of LKB1 reduces activation of autophagy by rapamycin in Tsc2-null cells. Similarly, shRNA-mediated depletion of p27 inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy. In support of p27 lying downstream of AMPK on the activation of autophagy in Tsc2-null cells, a p27 mutant that preferentially localizes in the cytosol recovered the effect of rapamycin on autophagy in both p27- and LKB1-depleted cells, but a nuclear p27 mutant was inactive. Finally, we show that p27-dependent activation of autophagy is involved in Tsc2-null cell survival under rapamycin treatment. These results indicate that an AMPK/p27 axis is promoting a survival mechanism that could explain in part the relapse of TSC tumors treated with rapamycin, exposing new avenues for designing more efficient treatments for TSC patients.",

    "issue": "13(3)",
    "pages": "371-82",
    "abstract": "The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is hyperactivated in a variety of cancers and disorders, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which are characterized by mutations in tumor suppressors TSC1 or TSC2. The concern with the use of mTORC1 inhibitors, such as rapamycin or its analogs (rapalogs), is that they cause upregulation of autophagy and suppress the negative feedback loop to Akt, which promotes cell survival, causing the therapy to be only partially effective, and relapse occurs upon cessation of treatment. In this study, we investigate the use of rapamycin in combination with resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, in TSC2-deficient cells. We tested whether such combination would prevent rapamycin-induced upregulation of autophagy and shift the cell fate toward apoptosis. We found that this combination treatment blocked rapamycin-induced upregulation of autophagy and restored inhibition of Akt. Interestingly, the combination of rapamycin and resveratrol selectively promoted apoptosis of TSC2-deficient cells. Thus, the addition of resveratrol to rapamycin treatment may be a promising option for selective and targeted therapy for diseases with TSC loss and mTORC1 hyperactivation.",

    "pages": "166-77",
    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene disorder with mutations of TSC1/TSC2 genes. This leads to the development of hamartomas that most frequently affect central nervous system, kidney, and skin. Angiomyolipomas are abdominal masses made up of muscle vessels and adipose tissues that grow mostly in proximity to kidneys and liver. Bleeding and kidney failure are the major justification for surgery. This study shows that angiomyolipoma-derived human smooth muscle TSC2-/- cells express the apoptosis inhibitor protein survivin when exposed to IGF-1. Survivin expression is also triggered whenever culture conditions perturb normal TSC2-/- cell function, such as the omission of EGF from the growth medium, the supplementation of anti-EGFR, blockade of PI3K and ERK, or inhibition of mTOR. Interestingly, single or simultaneous inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 and ERK by PD98059 does not prevent IGF-1-mediated survivin expression. Apoptogenic Smac/DIABLO, which is constitutively expressed by TSC2-/- A+ cells, is down-regulated by IGF-1 even in the presence of LY294002 and PD98059. These cells release IGF-1 by means of a negative feedback-regulated mechanism that is overrun when they are exposed to antibodies to IGF-1R, which increases the released amount by more than 400%. The autocrine release of IGF-1 may therefore be a powerful mechanism of survival of the tightly packed cells in the thick-walled vessels of TSC angiomyolipoma and in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) nodules. Future experimental therapies for TSC and LAM may result from the targeted inhibition of survivin, which may enhance sensitivity to TSC2 therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by hamartomatous tumors of the skin, kidneys, brain, and lungs. TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, which result in hyperactivation of the mTOR, leading to dysregulated cell growth and autophagy. Rapamycin (sirolimus) shrinks TSC tumors, but the clinical benefits of sirolimus are not sustained after its withdrawal. In this study, we studied the cellular processes critical for tumor formation and growth, including cell proliferation and cell size. TSC2-/- and TSC2+/- cells were isolated from TSC skin tumors and normal-appearing skin, respectively. Cells were incubated with sirolimus for 72 hours. Withdrawal of sirolimus from TSC2-/- cells resulted in a highly proliferative phenotype and caused cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, with persistent phosphorylation of mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, and 4EB-P1; decreased cyclin D kinase inhibitors; and transient hyperactivation of protein kinase B. Sirolimus modulated the estrogen- and autophagy-dependent volume of TSC2-/- cells. These results suggest that sirolimus may decrease the size of TSC tumors by reducing TSC2-/- cell volume, altering the cell cycle, and reprogramming TSC2-null cells.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of hamartomas in multiple organs. Up to 80% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex will have at least 1 angiomyolipoma in their lifetime. We describe the incidence and natural history of angiomyolipoma in a pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex population and analyze tumor growth to determine optimal renal imaging intervals in an effort to improve counseling, treatment and followup.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex from 2004 to 2014. Patients were included if they had a clinical or genetic diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and had undergone at least 1 renal imaging study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 145 patients were analyzed. Median age was 14 years (range 0 to 28). Overall incidence of angiomyolipoma was 50.3%. Median age at first angiomyolipoma detection was 11 years (range 2 to 26). Median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by age at first detection was 0.0 mm for patients 0 to 6 years old, 0.9 mm for those 7 to 11 years old, 2.5 mm for those 12 to 16 years old and 1.8 mm for those 17 years old or older. Median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by tumor size at first detection was 0.1 mm for tumors 0.6 to 0.9 cm, 1.8 mm for those 1.0 to 1.9 cm and 4.3 mm for those 2.0 to 2.9 cm. A total of 35 patients (24.1%) received mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors. Eight patients underwent a total of 13 surgical interventions, of whom 2 had previously been treated with mTOR inhibitors. Median patient age at surgical intervention was 18.0 years and median angiomyolipoma size was 5.0 cm.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAngiomyolipoma growth in children with tuberous sclerosis complex can be rapid and unpredictable. We recommend yearly renal ultrasound in all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, with consideration of magnetic resonance imaging in those at risk for rapid growth and future intervention (ie those older than 11 years and/or those with renal angiomyolipomas larger than 2 cm).",

    "issue": "116(8)",
    "pages": "2977-2986",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant syndrome that causes tumor formation in multiple organs. TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in the genes encoding TSC1/2, negative regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Diminished TSC function is associated with excess glycogen storage, but the causative mechanism is unknown. By studying human and mouse cells with defective or absent TSC2, we show that complete loss of TSC2 causes an increase in glycogen synthesis through mTORC1 hyperactivation and subsequent inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a negative regulator of glycogen synthesis. Specific TSC2 pathogenic mutations, however, result in elevated glycogen levels with no changes in mTORC1 or GSK3β activities. We identify mTORC1-independent lysosomal depletion and impairment of autophagy as the driving causes underlying abnormal glycogen storage in TSC irrespective of the underlying mutation. The defective autophagic degradation of glycogen is associated with abnormal ubiquitination and degradation of essential proteins of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, such as LC3 and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 and 2 (LAMP1/2) and is restored by the combined use of mTORC1 and Akt pharmacological inhibitors. In complementation to current models that place mTORC1 as the central therapeutic target for TSC pathogenesis, our findings identify mTORC1-independent pathways that are dysregulated in TSC and that should therefore be taken into account in the development of a therapeutic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, is characterized by benign tumor formation in multiple organs. Hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the primary alteration underlying TSC tumors. By analyzing Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-null ELT3 cells, we detected evidence for the involvement of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) as a downstream target of mTORC1 in the development of TSC tumors. We showed that loss of TSC2 led to decreased COX2 expression through activation of an mTORC1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Overexpression of COX2 promoted proliferation and tumoral growth of Tsc2-null cells. COX2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of the control cells. COX2 enhanced Tsc2-null cell growth through upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, rapamycin in combination with celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, strongly inhibited Tsc2-deficient cell growth. We conclude that downregulation of COX2 exerts a protective effect against hyperactivated mTORC1-mediated tumorigenesis caused by the loss of TSC2, and the combination of rapamycin and celecoxib may be an effective new approach to treating TSC.",

    "issue": "14(5)",
    "pages": "1224-35",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and hyperactivation of mTOR signaling plays a pivotal role in HCC tumorigenesis. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a heterodimer of TSC1 and TSC2, functions as a negative regulator of mTOR signaling. In the current study, we discovered that TSC2 loss-of-function is common in HCC. TSC2 loss was found in 4 of 8 HCC cell lines and 8 of 28 (28.6%) patient-derived HCC xenografts. TSC2 mutations and deletions are likely to be the underlying cause of TSC2 loss in HCC cell lines, xenografts, and primary tumors for most cases. We further demonstrated that TSC2-null HCC cell lines and xenografts had elevated mTOR signaling and, more importantly, were significantly more sensitive to RAD001/everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor. These preclinical findings led to the analysis of TSC2 status in HCC samples collected in the EVOLVE-1 clinical trial of everolimus using an optimized immunohistochemistry assay and identified 15 of 139 (10.8%) samples with low to undetectable levels of TSC2. Although the sample size is too small for formal statistical analysis, TSC2-null/low tumor patients who received everolimus tended to have longer overall survival than those who received placebo. Finally, we performed an epidemiology survey of more than 239 Asian HCC tumors and found the frequency of TSC2 loss to be approximately 20% in Asian HBV(+) HCC. Taken together, our data strongly argue that TSC2 loss is a predictive biomarker for the response to everolimus in HCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder affecting about 1 in 6000 people and is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. This disorder is characterized by increased activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is involved in regulating ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation. We measured the effects of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency (Tsc2+/- ) in 3-month-old male mice on regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) by means of the in vivo L-[1-14 C]leucine method. This quantitative autoradiographic method includes an estimate of the integrated specific activity of the tracer amino acid in brain tissue. The estimate accounts for recycling of unlabeled amino acids from tissue protein breakdown by means of a factor (λ) that was determined in control and Tsc2+/- mice. The value of λ was higher in Tsc2+/- mice, indicating that a greater fraction of leucine in the tissue precursor pool for protein synthesis is derived from the plasma compared to controls, consistent with reduced rates of protein degradation. We determined rCPS in freely moving, awake male Tsc2+/- and control mice, and we used the determined values of λ in the calculation of rCPS. Unexpectedly, we found that rCPS were significantly decreased in 16 of the 17 brain regions analyzed in Tsc2+/- mice compared to controls. Our results indicate a complex role of mTORC1 in the regulation of cerebral protein synthesis that has not been previously recognized.",

    "issue": "59(6)",
    "pages": "723-732",
    "abstract": "Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a slow-progressing metastatic disease that is driven by mutations in the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2). Rapamycin inhibits LAM cell proliferation and is the only approved treatment, but it cannot cause the regression of existing lesions and can only stabilize the disease. However, in other cancers, immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade against PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 have shown promise in causing tumor regression and even curing some patients. Thus, we asked whether PD-L1 has a role in LAM progression. In vitro, PD-L1 expression in murine Tsc2-null cells is unaffected by mTOR inhibition with torin but can be upregulated by IFN-γ. Using immunohistochemistry and single-cell flow cytometry, we found increased PD-L1 expression both in human lung tissue from patients with LAM and in Tsc2-null lesions in a murine model of LAM. In this model, PD-L1 is highly expressed in the lung by antigen-presenting and stromal cells, and activated T cells expressing PD-1 infiltrate the affected lung. In vivo treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody significantly prolongs mouse survival in the model of LAM. Together, these data demonstrate that PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression may occur in LAM, and suggest new opportunities for therapeutic targeting that may provide benefits beyond those of rapamycin.",

    "title": "A Double Negative Feedback Loop between mTORC1 and AMPK Kinases Guarantees Precise Autophagy Induction upon Cellular Stress.",
    "issue": "20(22)",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "Cellular homeostasis is controlled by an evolutionary conserved cellular digestive process called autophagy. This mechanism is tightly regulated by the two sensor elements called mTORC1 and AMPK. mTORC1 is one of the master regulators of proteostasis, while AMPK maintains cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is able to promote autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1, the key inducer of autophagosome formation, while mTORC1 downregulates the self-eating process via ULK1 under nutrient rich conditions. We claim that the feedback loops of the AMPK-mTORC1-ULK1 regulatory triangle guarantee the appropriate response mechanism when nutrient and/or energy supply changes. In our opinion, there is an essential double negative feedback loop between mTORC1 and AMPK. Namely, not only does AMPK downregulate mTORC1, but mTORC1 also inhibits AMPK and this inhibition is required to keep AMPK inactive at physiological conditions. The aim of the present study was to explore the dynamical characteristic of AMPK regulation upon various cellular stress events. We approached our scientific analysis from a systems biology perspective by incorporating both theoretical and molecular biological techniques. In this study, we confirmed that AMPK is essential to promote autophagy, but is not sufficient to maintain it. AMPK activation is followed by ULK1 induction, where protein has a key role in keeping autophagy active. ULK1-controlled autophagy is always preceded by AMPK activation. With both ULK1 depletion and mTORC1 hyper-activation (i.e., TSC1/2 downregulation), we demonstrate that a double negative feedback loop between AMPK and mTORC1 is crucial for the proper dynamic features of the control network. Our computer simulations have further proved the dynamical characteristic of AMPK-mTORC1-ULK1 controlled cellular nutrient sensing.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the beneficial effects of black rice anthocyanin extract (BRAE), which provides as an excellent source of dietary antioxidants, on the lifespan of fruit flies and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results showed that supplementation of BRAE extended the lifespan of fruit flies by 20% and retarded the loss of locomotor function. Comparison of mRNA transcriptome profile between fruit flies of 20 days and 50 days after the start of normal diet and normal diet supplemented with BRAE (5 mg/mL) identified 6687 differentially expressed coding genes. A large number of these differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes) analysis. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that up regulation in the glutathione metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and down regulation in FoxO signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway were most likely affected by supplementation of BRAE. In addition, several genes, including Zw (Zwischenferment), GstD2, GstE1, Gpx, Gclm, Tsc1, 4E-BP, DopR and D2R, which were involved in the pathways mentioned above, could be regulated by the supplementation of BRAE. Together, the results implicated that the expression of most of the mRNAs in fruit fly were closely associated with BRAE diet, which could provide a resource of mRNAs related in the field of aging and aging-related disease.",

    "pages": "683-691",
    "abstract": "Metachronous neoplasms have rarely been reported in patients with neuroblastoma. This report presents the clinical case of a 23-month-old child who was diagnosed with an anaplastic medulloblastoma 5 months after completing treatment for stage IV neuroblastoma. The patient was treated with complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation followed by maintenance chemotherapy at an outside institution and came to our institution for further management. A pathologic diagnosis and review of both the suprarenal and posterior fossa masses were performed, as well as a genetic analysis of both cerebellar tumor tissue and blood using next-generation gene sequencing. At our institution, the patient was submitted to induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and remains free of disease 2 years after completion of treatment. Genetic analysis revealed multiple somatic copy number variations with most deleted genes located in 2q37, a region which harbors genes involved in epigenetic regulation and tumor suppression. A homozygous deletion was found in the TSC2 gene, which is a clinically actionable gene, and patients with activating deletions in TSC2 can potentially be eligible for basket clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors. Germline single nucleotide variants were also identified in multiple genes involved in cancer (ALK, FGFR3, FLT3/4, HNF1A, NCOR1, and NOTCH2/3), cancer predisposition (TP53, TSC1, and BRCA1/2), and genes involved in DNA repair (MSH6, PMS2, POLE, and ATM). Metachronous neoplasms are rare and challenging to treat, hence genetic analysis and referral are needed to exclude hereditary cause. DNA sequencing of the tumor and germline can help identify alterations that increase predisposition or can be used to guide treatment decisions on recurrence and when standard options fail.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) can be sporadic or associated with TSC and is characterized by widespread pulmonary proliferation of abnormal α-smooth muscle (ASM)-like cells. We investigated the features of ASM cells isolated from chylous thorax of a patient affected by LAM associated with TSC, named LAM/TSC cells, bearing a germline TSC2 mutation and an epigenetic defect causing the absence of tuberin. Proliferation of LAM/TSC cells is epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent and blockade of EGF receptor causes cell death as we previously showed in cells lacking tuberin. LAM/TSC cells spontaneously detach probably for the inactivation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Akt/mTOR pathway and display the ability to survive independently from adhesion. Non-adherent LAM/TSC cells show an extremely low proliferation rate consistent with tumour stem-cell characteristics. Moreover, LAM/TSC cells bear characteristics of stemness and secrete high amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Anti-EGF receptor antibodies and rapamycin affect proliferation and viability of non-adherent cells. In conclusion, the understanding of LAM/TSC cell features is important in the assessment of cell invasiveness in LAM and TSC and should provide a useful model to test therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling their migratory ability.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral condylar hyperplasia (UCH) causes progressive asymmetry of the mandible. The aetiology of this growth disorder is unknown. A two-centre prospective study was established, and 10 consecutive adult UCH patients scheduled for high condylectomy were included. The resected condylar tissue was divided into two parts, one for regular histopathology and one for DNA extraction. A panel of eight selected overgrowth genes (AKT1, AKT3, MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3R2, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2) were sequenced using next-generation sequencing, with coverage of a minimum 500 times in order to be able to detect low-grade mosaicisms. Subsequently, untargeted whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to detect variants in other genes present in three or more patients. No mutation was detected in any of the overgrowth genes, and untargeted exome sequencing failed to detect any definitively causative variant in any other gene. Ten genes had a rare variant in three or more patients, but these cannot be designated as causative without additional functional studies. The hypothesis that the cause in at least some patients with UCH is a somatic mutation in a gene that controls cell growth could not be confirmed in this study.",

    "issue": "17(12)",
    "pages": "4071-81",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nRenal angiomyolipomas are a frequent manifestation of tuberous sclerosis and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). These disorders are associated with mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 that lead to overactivation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), suggesting an opportunity for targeted therapy by using mTORC1 inhibitors. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the mTORC1 inhibitor sirolimus for treatment of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with these disorders.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nIn this multicenter phase 2 nonrandomized open label trial, 16 patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM and renal angiomyolipoma(s) were treated with oral sirolimus for up to 2 years. Steady-state blood levels were 3 to 10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was change in size of renal angiomyolipomas measured by MRI and assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Secondary outcomes included safety, neurocognitive function, and pulmonary function.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate, by RECIST criteria, was 50%. Summated angiomyolipoma diameters were reduced in all 16 patients and by 30% or more in eight (all from the per protocol group of 10). Forty-one of 48 angiomyolipomas were smaller at the last measurement than at baseline. Most shrinkage occurred during the first year of treatment. There was little change in pulmonary function. Recall memory improved in seven of eight patients with tuberous sclerosis. Adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of sirolimus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed sustained regression of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM receiving 2 years of sirolimus treatment. Possible effects on pulmonary function and neurocognition require further investigation.",

    "pages": "18",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLung adenocarcinoma is a highly heterogeneous disease with various etiologies, prognoses, and responses to therapy. Although genome-scale characterization of lung adenocarcinoma has been performed, a comprehensive somatic mutation analysis of EGFR/KRAS/ALK-negative lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers has not been conducted.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 16 EGFR/KRAS/ALK-negative lung adenocarcinomas and additional 54 tumors in two expansion cohort sets. Candidate loci were validated by target capture and Sanger sequencing. Gene set analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 27 genes potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma. These included targetable genes involved in PI3K/mTOR signaling (TSC1, PIK3CA, AKT2) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (ERBB4) and genes not previously highlighted in lung adenocarcinomas, such as SETD2 and PBRM1 (chromatin remodeling), CHEK2 and CDC27 (cell cycle), CUL3 and SOD2 (oxidative stress), and CSMD3 and TFG (immune response). In the expansion cohort (N = 70), TP53 was the most frequently altered gene (11%), followed by SETD2 (6%), CSMD3 (6%), ERBB2 (6%), and CDH10 (4%). In pathway analysis, the majority of altered genes were involved in cell cycle/DNA repair (P <0.001) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling (P <0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe genomic makeup of EGFR/KRAS/ALK-negative lung adenocarcinomas in never-smokers is remarkably diverse. Genes involved in cell cycle regulation/DNA repair are implicated in tumorigenesis and represent potential therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Metabolic Heterogeneity of Cancer Cells: An Interplay between HIF-1, GLUTs, and AMPK.",
    "issue": "12(4)",
    "pages": "",
    "abstract": "It has been long recognized that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism under hypoxia conditions due to a shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis in order to meet elevated requirements in energy and nutrients for proliferation, migration, and survival. However, data accumulated over recent years has increasingly provided evidence that cancer cells can revert from glycolysis to OXPHOS and maintain both reprogrammed and oxidative metabolism, even in the same tumor. This phenomenon, denoted as cancer cell metabolic plasticity or hybrid metabolism, depends on a tumor micro-environment that is highly heterogeneous and influenced by an intensity of vasculature and blood flow, oxygen concentration, and nutrient and energy supply, and requires regulatory interplay between multiple oncogenes, transcription factors, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), among others. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) represent key modulators of a switch between reprogrammed and oxidative metabolism. The present review focuses on cross-talks between HIF-1, glucose transporters (GLUTs), and AMPK with other regulatory proteins including oncogenes such as c-Myc, p53, and KRAS; growth factor-initiated protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, phosphatydyl-3-kinase (PI3K), and mTOR signaling pathways; and tumor suppressors such as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and TSC1 in controlling cancer cell metabolism. The multiple switches between metabolic pathways can underlie chemo-resistance to conventional anti-cancer therapy and should be taken into account in choosing molecular targets to discover novel anti-cancer drugs.",

    "issue": "128(4)",
    "pages": "1688-1706",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominantly inherited disease caused by hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway and characterized by the development of hamartomas and benign tumors, including in the brain. Among the neurological manifestations associated with TSC, the tumor progression of static subependymal nodules (SENs) into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) is one of the major causes of morbidity and shortened life expectancy. To date, mouse modeling has failed in reproducing these 2 lesions. Here we report that simultaneous hyperactivation of mTORC1 and Akt pathways by codeletion of Tsc1 and Pten, selectively in postnatal neural stem cells (pNSCs), is required for the formation of bona fide SENs and SEGAs. Notably, both lesions closely recapitulate the pathognomonic morphological and molecular features of the corresponding human abnormalities. The establishment of long-term expanding pNSC lines from mouse SENs and SEGAs made possible the identification of mTORC2 as one of the mediators conferring tumorigenic potential to SEGA pNSCs. Notably, in spite of concurrent Akt hyperactivation in mouse brain lesions, single mTOR inhibition by rapamycin was sufficient to strongly impair mouse SEGA growth. This study provides evidence that, concomitant with mTORC1 hyperactivation, sustained activation of Akt and mTORC2 in pNSCs is a mandatory step for the induction of SENs and SEGAs, and, at the same time, makes available an unprecedented NSC-based in vivo/in vitro model to be exploited for identifying actionable targets in TSC.",

    "issue": "15(3)",
    "pages": "430-8",
    "abstract": "While pharmacoepidemiologic and laboratory studies have supported the hypothesis that the antidiabetic drug metformin may be useful in treating or preventing cancer, there is limited evidence to suggest which specific cancer sites may be particularly sensitive. Sensitivity likely is determined both by features of tumor pathophysiology and by pharmacokinetic factors. We used UPII-mutant Ha-ras transgenic mice that develop hyperplasia and low-grade, papillary urothelial cell carcinoma to determine whether metformin has activity in a model of superficial bladder cancer. Metformin significantly improved survival, reduced urinary tract obstruction, reduced bladder weight (a surrogate for tumor volume), and led to clear activation of AMP α kinase and inhibition of mTOR signaling in neoplastic tissue. We investigated the basis of the unusual sensitivity of this model to metformin, and observed that following oral dosing, urothelium is exposed to drug concentrations via the urine that are approximately 240-fold higher than those in the circulation. In addition, we observed that bladder cancer cell lines (RT4, UMUC-3, and J82) with homozygous deletion of either TSC1 or PTEN are more sensitive to metformin than those (TEU2, TCCSUP, and HT1376) with wild-type TSC1 and PTEN genes. Our findings provide a strong rationale for clinical trials of oral metformin in treatment of superficial bladder cancer.",

    "issue": "16(9)",
    "pages": "1635-1650",
    "abstract": "How lysosome and MTORC1 signaling interact remains elusive in terminally differentiated cells. A G4C2 repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9ALS-FTD). We previously identified a C9orf72-SMCR8-containing complex. Here we found that c9orf72 and smcr8 double-knockout (dKO) mice exhibit similar but more severe immune defects than the individual knockouts. In c9orf72 or smcr8 mutant macrophages, lysosomal degradation and exocytosis were impaired due to the disruption of autolysosome acidification. As a result of impaired lysosomal degradation, MTOR protein was aberrantly increased, resulting in MTORC1 signaling overactivation. Inhibition of hyperactive MTORC1 partially rescued macrophage dysfunction, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in c9orf72 or smcr8 mutant mice. Pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal degradation upregulated MTOR protein and MTORC1 signaling in differentiated wild-type macrophages, which resemble phenotypes in KO mice. In contrast, C9orf72 or Smcr8 depletion in proliferating macrophages decreased MTORC1 signaling. Our studies causatively link C9orf72-SMCR8's cellular functions in lysosomal degradation, exocytosis, and MTORC1 signaling with their organism-level immune regulation, suggesting cell state (proliferation vs. differentiation)-dependent regulation of MTOR signaling via lysosomes.Abbreviations: ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ATG13: autophagy related 13; BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; C9orf72: C9orf72, member of C9orf72-SMCR8 complex; CD68: CD68 antigen; ConA: concanamycin A; dKO: double knockout; DENN: differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells; FTD: frontotemporal dementia; GEF: guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IFNB1: interferon beta 1, fibroblast; IFNG: interferon gamma; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; iPSCs: induced pluripotent stem cells; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LPOs: LAMP1-positive organelles; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; MNs: motor neurons; NOS2/iNOS: nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible; RAN: repeat-associated non-AUG; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1; RPS6/S6: ribosomal protein S6; RPS6KB1/S6K1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1; SMCR8: Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosome region, candidate 8; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TSC1: TSC complex subunit 1; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1; v-ATPase: vacuolar-type H⁺-translocating ATPase.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an important regulator of cellular metabolism that is commonly hyperactivated in cancer. Recent cancer genome screens have identified multiple mutations in Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), the primary activator of mTORC1 that might act as driver oncogenes by causing hyperactivation of mTORC1. Here, we show that a number of recurrently occurring Rheb mutants drive hyperactive mTORC1 signalling through differing levels of insensitivity to the primary inactivator of Rheb, tuberous sclerosis complex. We show that two activated mutants, Rheb-T23M and E40K, strongly drive increased cell growth, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth resulting in enhanced tumour growth in vivo. Proteomic analysis of cells expressing the mutations revealed, surprisingly, that these two mutants promote distinct oncogenic pathways with Rheb-T23M driving an increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis, while Rheb-E40K regulates the translation factor eEF2 and autophagy, likely through differential interactions with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which modulate its activity. Our findings suggest that unique, personalized, combination therapies may be utilised to treat cancers according to which Rheb mutant they harbour.",

    "pages": "2449-2464",
    "abstract": "Somatic mutations have emerged as the likely cause of focal epilepsies associated with developmental malformations and epilepsy-associated glioneuronal tumors (GNT). Somatic BRAFV600E mutations in particular have been detected in the majority of low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LNETS) and in neurons in focal cortical dysplasias adjacent to epilepsy-associated tumors. Furthermore, conditional expression of an activating BRAF mutation in neocortex causes seizures in mice. In this study we characterized the cellular electrophysiology of layer 2/3 neocortical pyramidal neurons induced to express BRAFV600E from neural progenitor stages. In utero electroporation of a piggyBac transposase plasmid system was used to introduce transgenes expressing BRAF wild type (BRAFwt), BRAFV600E, and/or enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) into radial glia progenitors in mouse embryonic cortex. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings of pyramidal neurons in slices prepared from both juvenile and adult mice showed that BRAFV600E resulted in neurons with a distinct hyperexcitable phenotype characterized by depolarized resting membrane potentials, increased input resistances, lowered action potential (AP) thresholds, and increased AP firing frequencies. Some of the BRAFV600E-expressing neurons normally destined for upper cortical layers by their birthdate were stalled in their migration and occupied lower cortical layers. BRAFV600E-expressing neurons also displayed increased hyperpolarization-induced inward currents (Ih) and decreased sustained potassium currents. Neurons adjacent to BRAFV600E transgene-expressing neurons, and neurons with TSC1 genetically deleted by CRISPR or those induced to carry PIK3CAE545K transgenes, did not show an excitability phenotype similar to that of BRAFV600E-expressing neurons. Together, these results indicate that BRAFV600E leads to a distinct hyperexcitable neuronal phenotype.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to report the cell autonomous effects of BRAFV600E mutations on the intrinsic neuronal excitability. We show that BRAFV600E alters multiple electrophysiological parameters in neocortical neurons. Similar excitability changes did not occur in cells neighboring BRAFV600E-expressing neurons, after overexpression of wild-type BRAF transgenes, or after introduction of mutations affecting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA). We conclude that BRAFV600E causes a distinct, cell autonomous, highly excitable neuronal phenotype when introduced somatically into neocortical neuronal progenitors.",

    "title": "Mutational Profile of Metastatic Breast Cancers: A Retrospective Analysis.",
    "issue": "13(12)",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMajor advances have been achieved in the characterization of early breast cancer (eBC) genomic profiles. Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is associated with poor outcomes, yet limited information is available on the genomic profile of this disease. This study aims to decipher mutational profiles of mBC using next-generation sequencing.\n\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS\nWhole-exome sequencing was performed on 216 tumor-blood pairs from mBC patients who underwent a biopsy in the context of the SAFIR01, SAFIR02, SHIVA, or Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization (MOSCATO) prospective trials. Mutational profiles from 772 primary breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as a reference for comparing primary and mBC mutational profiles. Twelve genes (TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, ESR1, MAP3K1, CDH1, AKT1, MAP2K4, RB1, PTEN, CBFB, and CDKN2A) were identified as significantly mutated in mBC (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1). Eight genes (ESR1, FSIP2, FRAS1, OSBPL3, EDC4, PALB2, IGFN1, and AGRN) were more frequently mutated in mBC as compared to eBC (FDR < 0.01). ESR1 was identified both as a driver and as a metastatic gene (n = 22, odds ratio = 29, 95% CI [9-155], p = 1.2e-12) and also presented with focal amplification (n = 9) for a total of 31 mBCs with either ESR1 mutation or amplification, including 27 hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 negative (HER2-) mBCs (19%). HR+/HER2- mBC presented a high prevalence of mutations on genes located on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (TSC1 and TSC2) as compared to HR+/HER2- eBC (respectively 6% and 0.7%, p = 0.0004). Other actionable genes were more frequently mutated in HR+ mBC, including ERBB4 (n = 8), NOTCH3 (n = 7), and ALK (n = 7). Analysis of mutational signatures revealed a significant increase in APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in HR+/HER2- metastatic tumors as compared to primary TCGA samples (p < 2e-16). The main limitations of this study include the absence of bone metastases and the size of the cohort, which might not have allowed the identification of rare mutations and their effect on survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work reports the results of the analysis of the first large-scale study on mutation profiles of mBC. This study revealed genomic alterations and mutational signatures involved in the resistance to therapies, including actionable mutations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular evidence has linked the pathophysiology of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) to that of metastatic breast cancer. Following on this observation, we assessed the association between LAM and subsequent breast cancer. An epidemiological study was carried out using three LAM country cohorts, from Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The number of incident breast cancer cases observed in these cohorts was compared with the number expected on the basis of the country-specific incidence rates for the period 2000-2014. Immunohistochemical studies and exome sequence analysis were performed in two and one tumors, respectively. All cohorts revealed breast cancer standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) ≥ 2.25. The combined analysis of all cases or restricted to pre-menopausal age groups revealed significantly higher incidence of breast cancer: SIR = 2.81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-5.57, P = 0.009; and SIR = 4.88, 95 % CI = 2.29-9.99, P = 0.0007, respectively. Immunohistochemical analyses showed positivity for known markers of lung metastatic potential. This study suggests the existence of increased breast cancer risk among LAM patients. Prospective studies may be warranted to corroborate this result, which may be particularly relevant for pre-menopausal women with LAM.",

    "pages": "1807-1822",
    "abstract": "Age-related impairment of macroautophagy/autophagy and loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis contribute significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) signaling is the most well-known regulator of autophagy, cellular homeostasis, and longevity. The MTOR signaling consists of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, MTORC1 and MTORC2. While MTORC1 is well characterized but the role of MTORC2 in aging and autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we identified TGFB-INHB/activin signaling as a novel upstream regulator of MTORC2 to control autophagy and cardiac health during aging. Using Drosophila heart as a model system, we show that cardiac-specific knockdown of TGFB-INHB/activin-like protein daw induces autophagy and alleviates age-related heart dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and bradycardia. Interestingly, the downregulation of daw activates TORC2 signaling to regulate cardiac autophagy. Activation of TORC2 alone through overexpressing its subunit protein rictor promotes autophagic flux and preserves cardiac function with aging. In contrast, activation of TORC1 does not block autophagy induction in daw knockdown flies. Lastly, either daw knockdown or rictor overexpression in fly hearts prolongs lifespan, suggesting that manipulation of these pathways in the heart has systemic effects on longevity control. Thus, our studies discover the TGFB-INHB/activin-mediated inhibition of TORC2 as a novel mechanism for age-dependent decreases in autophagic activity and cardiac health.

    "title": "N-Myc and STAT Interactor regulates autophagy and chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells.",
    "issue": "5()",
    "pages": "11995",
    "abstract": "We have previously reported that expression of NMI (N-myc and STAT interactor) is compromised in invasive breast cancers. We also demonstrated that loss of NMI expression promotes epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and results in enhanced invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Additionally we had demonstrated that restoration of NMI expression reduced breast cancer xenograft growth and downregulated Wnt and TGFβ/SMAD signaling. Here we present our observations that NMI expression drives autophagy. Our studies were promoted by our observation that NMI expressing breast cancer cells showed autophagic vacuoles and LC3 processing. Additionally, we found that NMI expression increased the cisplatin sensitivity of the breast cancer cells. Our mechanistic investigations show that NMI prompts activation of GSK3-β. This multifunctional kinase is an upstream effector of the TSC1/TSC2 complex that regulates mTOR signaling. Inhibition of GSK3-β activity in NMI expressing cells activated mTOR signaling and decreased the cells' autophagic response. Additionally we demonstrate that a key component of autophagy, DNA-damage regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1), is regulated by NMI. Our TCGA database analysis reveals concurrent expression of NMI and DRAM1 in breast cancer specimens. We present evidence that NMI sensitizes breast cancer cells to cisplatin treatment through DRAM1 dependent autophagy.",

    "title": "Tumor suppression and promotion by autophagy.",
    "issue": "2014()",
    "pages": "603980",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly regulated catabolic process that involves lysosomal degradation of proteins and organelles, mostly mitochondria, for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and reduction of metabolic stress. Problems in the execution of this process are linked to different pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration, aging, and cancer. Many of the proteins that regulate autophagy are either oncogenes or tumor suppressor proteins. Specifically, tumor suppressor genes that negatively regulate mTOR, such as PTEN, AMPK, LKB1, and TSC1/2 stimulate autophagy while, conversely, oncogenes that activate mTOR, such as class I PI3K, Ras, Rheb, and AKT, inhibit autophagy, suggesting that autophagy is a tumor suppressor mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, the inhibition of autophagy promotes oxidative stress, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, autophagy also functions as a cytoprotective mechanism under stress conditions, including hypoxia and nutrient starvation, that promotes tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy in established tumors. Here, in this brief review, we will focus the discussion on this ambiguous role of autophagy in the development and progression of cancer.",

Since protein kinases are integral to the autophagy process, it is critically important to understand the role of kinases in autophagic regulation. At present, intervention of autophagic processes by small-molecule modulators targeting specific kinases has becoming a reasonable and prevalent strategy for treating several varieties of human disease, especially cancer. In this review, we describe the role of some autophagy-related kinase targets and kinase-mediated phosphorylation mechanisms in autophagy regulation. We also summarize the small-molecule kinase inhibitors/activators of these targets, highlighting the opportunities of these new therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Despite a prevalence exceeding 1%, mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are poorly understood, and targeted therapies and guiding parameters are urgently needed. We recently demonstrated that cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to generate autistic-like behaviors in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Here, using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitor rapamycin, we define distinct sensitive periods for treatment of autistic-like behaviors with sensitive periods extending into adulthood for social behaviors. We identify cellular and electrophysiological parameters that may contribute to behavioral rescue, with rescue of Purkinje cell survival and excitability corresponding to social behavioral rescue. In addition, using anatomic and diffusion-based MRI, we identify structural changes in cerebellar domains implicated in ASD that correlate with sensitive periods of specific autism-like behaviors. These findings thus not only define treatment parameters into adulthood, but also support a mechanistic basis for the targeted rescue of autism-related behaviors.",

    "issue": "10(9)",
    "pages": "e0138188",
    "abstract": "Precise regulation of synapses during development is essential to ensure accurate neural connectivity and function of nervous system. Many signaling pathways, including the mTOR (mechanical Target of Rapamycin) pathway operate in neurons to maintain genetically determined number of synapses during development. mTOR, a kinase, is shared between two functionally distinct multi-protein complexes- mTORC1 and mTORC2, that act downstream of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). We and others have suggested an important role for TSC in synapse development at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. In addition, our data suggested that the regulation of the NMJ synapse numbers in Drosophila largely depends on signaling via mTORC2. In the present study, we further this observation by identifying Tricornered (Trc) kinase, a serine/threonine kinase as a likely mediator of TSC signaling. trc genetically interacts with Tsc2 to regulate the number of synapses. In addition, Tsc2 and trc mutants exhibit a dramatic reduction in synaptic levels of WASP, an important regulator of actin polymerization. We show that Trc regulates the WASP levels largely, by regulating the transcription of WASP. Finally, we show that overexpression of WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) in trc mutants can suppress the increase in the number of synapses observed in trc mutants, suggesting that WASP regulates synapses downstream of Trc. Thus, our data provide a novel insight into how Trc may regulate the genetic program that controls the number of synapses during development.",

    "issue": "9(10)",
    "pages": "e104809",
    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis syndrome (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor gene syndrome affecting multiple organs, including renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). LAM is a female-predominant interstitial lung disease characterized by the progressive cyst formation and respiratory failure, which is also seen in sporadic patients without TSC. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 cause TSC, result in hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and are also seen in LAM cells in sporadic LAM. We recently reported that prostaglandin biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase-2 were deregulated in TSC and LAM. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of plasma membrane phospholipids into prostaglandins. In this study, we identified upregulation of adipocyte AdPLA2 (PLA2G16) in LAM nodule cells using publicly available expression data. We showed that the levels of AdPLA2 transcript and protein were higher in LAM lungs compared with control lungs. We then showed that TSC2 negatively regulates the expression of AdPLA2, and loss of TSC2 is associated with elevated production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in cell culture models. Mouse model studies also showed increased expression of AdPLA2 in xenograft tumors, estrogen-induced lung metastatic lesions of Tsc2 null leiomyoma-derived cells, and spontaneous renal cystadenomas from Tsc2+/- mice. Importantly, rapamycin treatment did not affect the expression of AdPLA2 and the production of PGE2 by TSC2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (Tsc2-/-MEFs), rat uterine leiomyoma-derived ELT3 cells, and LAM patient-associated renal angiomyolipoma-derived \"mesenchymal\" cells. Furthermore, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP), a potent irreversible PLA2 inhibitor, selectively suppressed the growth and induced apoptosis of TSC2-deficient LAM patient-derived cells relative to TSC2-addback cells. Our findings suggest that AdPLA2 plays an important role in promoting tumorigenesis and disease progression by modulating the production of prostaglandins and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in TSC and LAM.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTuberous sclerosis (TSC) related tumors are characterized by constitutively activated mTOR signaling due to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe completed a phase 2 multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, for the treatment of kidney angiomyolipomas.\n\n\nRESULTS\n36 adults with TSC or TSC/LAM were enrolled and started on daily sirolimus. The overall response rate was 44.4% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 28 to 61); 16/36 had a partial response. The remainder had stable disease (47.2%, 17/36), or were unevaluable (8.3%, 3/36). The mean decrease in kidney tumor size (sum of the longest diameters [sum LD]) was 29.9% (95% CI, 22 to 37; n = 28 at week 52). Drug related grade 1-2 toxicities that occurred with a frequency of >20% included: stomatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, bone marrow suppression (anemia, mild neutropenia, leucopenia), proteinuria, and joint pain. There were three drug related grade 3 events: lymphopenia, headache, weight gain. Kidney angiomyolipomas regrew when sirolimus was discontinued but responses tended to persist if treatment was continued after week 52. We observed regression of brain tumors (SEGAs) in 7/11 cases (26% mean decrease in diameter), regression of liver angiomyolipomas in 4/5 cases (32.1% mean decrease in longest diameter), subjective improvement in facial angiofibromas in 57%, and stable lung function in women with TSC/LAM (n = 15). A correlative biomarker study showed that serum VEGF-D levels are elevated at baseline, decrease with sirolimus treatment, and correlate with kidney angiomyolipoma size (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.54, p = 0.001, at baseline).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSirolimus treatment for 52 weeks induced regression of kidney angiomyolipomas, SEGAs, and liver angiomyolipomas. Serum VEGF-D may be a useful biomarker for monitoring kidney angiomyolipoma size. Future studies are needed to determine benefits and risks of longer duration treatment in adults and children with TSC.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT00126672.",

    "abstract": "Improving litter size at birth (TNB) and the number of piglets born alive (NBA) are the main breeding goals related to litter traits, which are economically important. A better understanding of genetic architecture underlying TNB and NBA traits could increase pig production efficiency. However, most previous studies on these traits focus on additive genetic effects, while epistatic interactions underlying TNB and NBA traits has not yet been well investigated, which are essential to understand how traits-related genes interact. Herein, we conducted genome scans of epistatic interactions underlying TNB and NBA traits in a total of 150 Chinese indigenous pigs (75 Jinhua and 75 Shengxian Spotted pigs) with high throughput genomic data. Based on SNPs with high interaction values and connectivity scores, we identified eight promising candidate genes (AKT2, TSC1, MTOR, PIK3R5, TIAM1, FGF14, RALB and ROR2) potentially associated with litter traits in pigs. Moreover, the underlying pathways, e.g., calcium ion transport, pointed out their roles in litter size-related traits. Our findings provide new insight into genetic architecture of litter traits in pigs and will benefit economic profits in pig production.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To study the clinicopathological features, immunohistochemical phenotype, molecular changes, differential diagnosis and prognosis of eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC). Methods: A total of 15 cases were selected from 2005 to 2019 at Nanjing Jinling Hospital,Nanjing University School of Medicine for clinicopathological and immunohistochemical analysis, 10 of which were subject to cancer-associated mutation analysis using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. A literature review was also performed. Results: The patients' ages ranged from 15 to 68 years (mean, 33 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.1∶1.0. During a mean follow-up of 22 months, none of the patients developed tumor recurrence, progression or metastasis. Histologically, the tumors typically demonstrated solid and cystic architectures and the neoplastic cells contained voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm with prominent granular cytoplasmic stippling. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells in all cases were immunoreactive for CK20. Signal pathway related protein mTOR and S6 were positive in 14/15 and 6/15 cases, respectively. Cathepsin K, Melan A and HMB45 were at least focally positive in 12/15, 6/15 and 2/15 cases, respectively. CK7 and CD10 showed focal immunostain positivity in some cases, while TFE3, TFEB, CA9 and CD117 were negative in all cases. NGS demonstrated TSC1/TSC2 mutations in all tested cases (10/10). Conclusions: ESC RCC is a rare tumor that tends to occur in young patients with an indolent behavior. Diagnosis can be established by its distinct clinical and histopathologic findings, immunohistochemical phenotype and molecular genetics. The tumor may be considered as a new subtype of RCC.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE\nUnlike clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) and renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) are rare tumors that progress rapidly and appear resistant to current systemic therapies. We queried comprehensive genomic profiling to uncover opportunities for targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nDNA was extracted from 40 microns of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen from relapsed, mCDC (n = 46), mRMC (n = 24), and refractory and metastatic (m) mCCRCC (n = 626). Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed, and Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) were calculated. We analyzed all classes of genomic alterations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nmCDC had 1.7 versus 2.7 genomic alterations/tumor in mCCRCC ( = 0.04). Mutations in VHL (P < 0.0001) and TSC1 (P = 0.04) were more frequent in mCCRCC. SMARCB1 (P < 0.0001), NF2 (P = 0.0007), RB1 (P = 0.02) and RET (P = 0.0003) alterations were more frequent in mCDC versus mCCRCC. No VHL alterations in mRMC and mCDC were identified. SMARCB1 genomic alterations were significantly more frequent in mRMC than mCDC (P = 0.0002), but were the most common alterations in both subtypes. Mutations to EGFR, RET, NF2, and TSC2 were more frequently identified in mCDC versus mRMC. The median TMB and MSI-High status was low with <1% of mCCRC, mCDC, and mRMC having ≥ 20 mut/Mb.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGenomic alteration patterns in mCDC and mRMC differ significantly from mCCRCC. Targeted therapies for mCDC and mRMC appear limited with rare opportunities to target alterations in receptor tyrosine kinase and MTOR pathways. Similarly, TMB and absence of MSI-High status in mCDC and mRMC suggest resistance to immunotherapies.",

    "issue": "38(10)",
    "pages": "755-762",
    "abstract": "The last 30 years of research in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has revealed that the vast majority of RCC histologies share a recurrent pattern of mutations to metabolic genes, including VHL, MTOR, ELOC, TSC1/2, FH, SDH, and mitochondrial DNA. This has prompted intense study of the consequences of these mutations on cellular metabolism and physiology in vivo by leveraging high-throughput technologies to measure small-molecule metabolites (i.e., metabolomics). The purpose of this review is to give a broad and integrated view on the discoveries made in RCC with metabolomics, and to give a basic understanding of the experimental design of metabolomic studies. Our discussion is organized around five concepts which synthesize discoveries from genomics and metabolomics into the molecular basis of RCC and transcend the different RCC histologies: (1) metabolic phenotypes unique to certain genotypes, (2) mitochondrial dysfunction, (3) the oxidative stress response, (4) epigenetics, and (5) therapy targeted to metabolism. We conclude by proposing several promising lines of investigation that intersect metabolism with emerging ideas in RCC biology.",

    "issue": "23(2)",
    "pages": "234-242",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSarcomas comprise over 50 subtypes of mesenchymal cancers. For the majority of sarcomas, the driver mutations remain unknown. In this article, we describe our experience with a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in clinic patients.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed results of NGS using 133 tumor samples from patients diagnosed with a variety of sarcomas that were analyzed with targeted NGS covering over 400 cancer-related genes (405 DNA, 265 RNA) on a commercially available platform.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn average of two gene alterations were identified per tumor sample (range 0-14), and a total of 342 DNA mutations were detected. Eight-eight percent of samples had at least one detected mutation. The most common mutations were in the cell cycle, including TP53 (n = 35), CDKN2A/B (n = 23), and RB1 (n = 19). Twenty-seven PI3-kinase pathway alterations were observed, including PTEN (n = 14), PIK3Ca (n = 4), TSC1 (n = 1), TSC2 (n = 3), STK11 (n = 1), mTOR (n = 3), and RICTOR (n = 2). There were 75 mutations in genes that are targetable with existing drugs (excluding KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumor) that would allow enrollment onto clinical trials. In general, the estimated tumor mutation burden was low, in particular for those with disease-defining gene fusions or genetic alterations. Microsatellite instability (MSI) data were available for 50 patients, and all were MSI stable.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study describes a single-center experience with targeted NGS for patients with sarcoma. Mutations were readily detected and 75 (representing 40% of patients) were testable for therapeutic effect using existing drugs within the confines of a clinical trial. These data indicate that targeted NGS is a useful tool in potentially routing patients to mutation-specific clinical trials. Further study will be required to determine if these mutations are clinically meaningful drug targets in sarcoma.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nThe sarcomas are a heterogenous family of over 50 different mesenchymal tumors. Current practice for metastatic disease involves systemic chemotherapy or nonspecific kinase inhibitors such as pazopanib. Sarcomas typically lack the classic kinase alterations seen in many carcinomas. The role of next-generation sequencing in sarcoma clinical practice remains undefined.",
